<h2><span class="h2line1">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>Continuing the argument set forth in the &ldquo;Life of
Gen. Lee for Children,&rdquo; that we can advance primary
education and impress lessons of morality upon children
in no better way than to place before them the careers
of our great men, I now give, in simple words, the &ldquo;Life
of Gen. Thos. J. Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this brief sketch of our great Southern hero, I have
endeavored to portray, amid the blaze of his matchless
military genius, the unchanging rectitude of his conduct,
the stern will-power by which he conquered all difficulties,
his firm belief in an overruling Providence, and
his entire submission to the Divine Will. These traits
of character were the corner-stones upon which he
reared the edifice of his greatness, and upon which the
young people of our day will do well to build.</p>
<p>Teachers may introduce this book as a supplementary
reader into the fourth grade, as I have been careful to
employ as few words as possible outside of the vocabulary
of that grade.</p>
<p>In preparing this work, I used chiefly as reference and
authority the Life of Lieut.-Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, by
Prof. R. L. Dabney, D. D., who was, for a time, Jackson&rsquo;s
chief of staff, and who had personal knowledge of
his character and military exploits.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment is due Col. James H. Morrison for
valuable assistance rendered, and to Mrs. Thomas J.
Jackson, of Charlotte, N. C., and Mr. M. Miley, of Lexington,
Va., for furnishing valuable illustrative matter.</p>
<p>I am also indebted to the kindness of Messrs. Paxton
and Henkel, the editors, respectively, of the <i>Rockbridge
County News</i> and the <i>Shenandoah Valley</i>, for files of their
reliable journals, containing accounts of the more recent
events recorded in the last chapter.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">An Orphan Boy.</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Jonathan Jackson was born January
21, 1824, at Clarksburg, West Virginia,
which state was then a part of old Virginia.
He sprang from Scotch-Irish stock. His
great-grandfather, John Jackson, was born
in Ireland, but his parents moved to the
city of London when John was only two
years old. John Jackson grew up to be a
great trader. In 1748 he came to the New
World to make his fortune, and landed in
the State of Maryland. Not long after, he
married Elizabeth Cummins, a young woman
who was noted for her good looks, fine mind,
and great height.</p>

<p>John Jackson with his wife soon moved
West, and at last took up lands in what is
now known as Upshur county, West Virginia.
As land was then cheap, he soon owned a
large tract of country, and was a rich man
for those times. He was greatly aided by
his brave wife, Elizabeth. In those days
the Indians still made war upon the whites,
who would flee for safety into the forts or
strongholds. It is said that in more than
one of those Indian raids Elizabeth Jackson
aided in driving off the foe.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>When the great Revolutionary war came
on, John Jackson and several of his sons
marched to the war; and at its close came
back safe to their Virginia home. In these
lovely and fertile valleys, John Jackson and
his wife Elizabeth passed long and active
lives. The husband lived to be eighty-six
years old, while his wife lived to the great
age of one hundred and five years. Her
strength of body and mind fitted her to
rear a race of mighty men.</p>
<p>Thomas Jonathan was the great-grandson
of these good people. His father, Jonathan
Jackson, was a lawyer. He is said to
have been a man of good mind and kind
heart. Thomas&rsquo;s mother was Julia Neale,
the daughter of a merchant in the then
village of Parkersburg, on the Ohio river.
Mrs. Jackson was good and beautiful.
Thomas had one brother, Warren, and two
sisters, Elizabeth and Laura. Not long after
the birth of the baby Laura, Elizabeth was
taken sick with fever and died. Her father,
worn out with nursing, was also taken ill;
and two weeks after her death he was laid
in a grave by her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>After his death it was found that he had
left no property for his widow and babes.
They were now without a home, and the Masonic
Order gave the widow a house of one
room. Here she sewed, and taught school,
caring as well as she could for her little
fatherless children.</p>
<p>In the year 1830 she married Mr. Woodson,
a lawyer, who was pleased with her
youth and beauty. Her children&mdash;Warren,
Thomas, and Laura&mdash;were now claimed by
their father&rsquo;s family, who did not like the
second marriage of the mother.</p>
<p>As her new husband was not a rich man,
she was at last forced to give them up. Little
Jonathan, then only seven years old, was
placed behind good, old &ldquo;Uncle Robinson,&rdquo;
the last of his father&rsquo;s slaves, and sent away
to his aunt, Mrs. Brake, who lived about four
miles from Clarksburg.</p>
<p>After being one year at his aunt&rsquo;s he was
sent for to see his mother die. Death for
her had no sting; and Thomas, long years
after, said that her dying words and prayers
had never been erased from his heart. She
was laid to rest not far from the famous
Hawk&rsquo;s Nest, on New river, West Virginia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Jonathan was then a pretty child, with
rosy cheeks, wavy brown hair, and deep-blue
eyes. It is said of him that, as a child, he
was strangely quiet and manly. The sadness
of his young life made him grave and
thoughtful beyond his years. When he was
but eight years old he went one day to the
home of his father&rsquo;s cousin, Judge John G.
Jackson, in Clarksburg.</p>
<p>While eating his dinner, he said to Mrs.
Jackson in a quiet way, &ldquo;Uncle and I don&rsquo;t
agree. I have quit him and shall not go
back any more.&rdquo; His kind cousin tried to
show him that he was in fault and that he
should go back to his Uncle Brake. He
only shook his head and said more firmly
than ever, &ldquo;No, uncle and I don&rsquo;t agree.
I have quit him and shall not go back any
more.&rdquo; It seems that his uncle had tried to
govern him by force rather than through his
sense of right and wrong. So, this strange
child calmly made up his mind not to stay
where there would be constant warfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>From Judge Jackson&rsquo;s he went that evening
to the home of another cousin, who also
tried to persuade him to return to his Uncle
Brake. But Jonathan only said, &ldquo;I have
quit there. I shall not go back there any
more.&rdquo; The next morning he set out alone
and on foot, and went eighteen miles to the
home of his uncle, Cummins Jackson, the
half-brother of his father.</p>
<p>There he found his brother Warren, and
soon felt quite at home with his kind uncle
and aunts. His Uncle Cummins was a
bachelor, who owned a fine farm and mills,
and was one of the largest slave-owners in
Lewis county.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>He was quite fond of his little nephew,
and took pains to teach him all the arts of
country life. He treated him more as an
equal than as a child, for he saw at once the
noble nature with which he had to deal. He
also sent Thomas and Warren to the nearest
county school, but Warren, now a bold lad
of fourteen years, did not like such restraint.
He at last induced Thomas to go with him
from their uncle&rsquo;s home to seek their fortunes
in the great West.</p>
<p>After stopping for a time at the home of
their uncle on the Ohio river, they went
down that river, and for some months were
not heard from.</p>
<p>In the fall of that year, they returned to
their kind friends, ragged, and ill with chills
and fever.</p>
<p>Their story was that they made a raft
and floated down to one of the lonely islands
in the Mississippi river near the Kentucky
shore, where they cut wood for steamboats
on the river. Here they spent the summer
alone, with little food, in the midst of a
dense forest surrounded by the turbid, rushing
waters of the great Mississippi.</p>
<p>At last, illness forced them to seek their
way homeward; and Thomas boldly said
that he was going back to his good Uncle
Cummins. Warren stopped at the home of
his Uncle Brake, but disease had laid so
firm a hold upon him that, after lingering a
few years, he died, aged about nineteen.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Warren and Thomas on the Ohio river.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Thomas and Laura were now all that were
left of the little family. They lived together
for several months at their Uncle Cummins&rsquo;s,
and it is told of Thomas that he was very
fond of his little sister. Across the brook
from the house was a large grove of sugar-maple
trees where they would go to play
&ldquo;making sugar.&rdquo; It was a great pleasure
to Thomas to build bridges for his little
sister to walk on in crossing the stream, and
many were the delights of the cool and
fragrant forests. But in a short time Laura
was sent to live with her mother&rsquo;s friends
in Wood county, and Thomas was left alone.
Though they could not live together, Thomas
always cherished the warmest love for his
sister, and the very first money he ever earned
was spent in buying a silk dress for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Thomas now went to school to Mr. Robert
P. Ray. He showed no aptness for any
study except arithmetic. When called upon
to recite a lesson, he would flatly say that
he did not understand it and, therefore, was
not ready; nor would he go to the next lesson
until he had learned the first perfectly. Thus,
he was always behind his class. He was
never surly at school, but was always ready
for a merry romp or play. When there
were games of &ldquo;bat and ball&rdquo; or &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s
base,&rdquo; he was sure to be chosen captain of
one side, and that side generally won.</p>
<p>As long as he was treated fairly by his
playmates, he was gentle and yielding; but,
if he thought himself wronged, he did not
hesitate to fight it out. It is said that he
would never admit that he had been beaten
in a fray, and was always ready to renew the
contest when his foe assailed him again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In the summer, Thomas worked on the
farm and became of use to his uncle in
many ways. One of his most frequent tasks
was to haul great logs of oak and pine from
the wood to the saw-mill. He, thus, became
a famous driver of oxen, and was known
throughout the country-side as a young man
of great strength and courage.</p>
<p>So his life was passed, from nine to sixteen,
between the school and the farm. He
was then like his father, of low stature, but
he afterwards grew tall like the men of his
mother&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>About this time, he was made constable of
one-half of Lewis county. We see him now
with his bag of bills and account books
going up and down the hills of Lewis county.
In this work he had to be firm and exact,
for it was now his task to collect money due
for debts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>This story is told of his nerve and skill in
doing this unpleasant duty. A man who
owed a debt of ten dollars promised to pay
it at a given time. The day came and the
man failed to keep his word. Young Jackson
paid the money out of his own purse,
and then watched for the man who would
not pay his debt. The very next morning
the man came riding up the street on a good
horse. Jackson at once taxed him with not
keeping his word, and was going to take the
horse for the debt, when the latter resisted,
and a fierce fight took place in the street.
In the midst of the fray the man mounted
his horse and was riding off.</p>
<p>Jackson, however, sprang forward and
seized the bridle. Seeing that he could get
the man off the horse in no other way, he
led it to the low door of a stable near by.
The man cuffed him right and left, but Jackson
clung to the bridle, and pulled the horse
into the stable. The man was thus forced
to slide off to keep from being knocked off;
and Jackson got the horse.</p>
<p>Though this life in the open air was good
for the health of our hero, it did not benefit
his morals. He was kept much from home,
and was thrown with the worst class of
people in the county.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>

<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="Jackson on horseback" width="509" height="801" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>His aunts had now married, and his Uncle
Cummins was keeping &ldquo;bachelor&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;
He also kept race horses, and none save
Thomas could ride for him if a contest was
close.</p>
<p>It was said through all that country that
if a horse could win, he would do so if young
Tom Jackson rode him in the race.</p>
<p>It is sad to think of this young man
thrown upon the world without mother or
sister or any human influence, save his own
will, to keep him in the right way. But
in this wild, rough life the great wish of
his heart was to reach that condition from
which he had been thrust when left a poor
orphan boy. And even now the great God,
who has said that He will be a father to the
fatherless, was opening up a way to a great
and notable career.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Cadet.</span></h2>
<p>In 1842, the place of a cadet in the great
academy at West Point became vacant. In
that school or academy the young men of
the United States are trained to become
soldiers. Thomas at once sought and secured
the place, and very soon set out on horseback
to Clarksburg, where he would take
the coach going to Washington.</p>
<p>He was clad in home-spun clothes, and
his whole wardrobe was packed in a pair of
saddle-bags.</p>
<p>When he reached Clarksburg, he found
that the coach had passed by; but he rode
on until he overtook it and then went on to
Washington city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He was kindly met by his friend Mr.
Hays, member of Congress from his district,
who took him at once to the Secretary of
War. The latter was so pleased with his
manly bearing and direct speech that he
ordered his warrant to be made out at once.</p>
<p>Mr. Hays wished him to stay in Washington
for a few days in order to see the sights
of the city, but he was content to climb to
the top of the dome of the Capitol, from
which he could view the whole scene at
once. He was then ready to go on to West
Point for examination. His great trouble
now was the thought that he might not
know enough to stand that examination.</p>
<p>Mr. Hays wrote to his friends at the
academy and asked them to be easy in
examining the mountain boy, who wished so
much to be a soldier; and it is said that
they asked him no very hard questions.</p>
<p>Thomas was now eighteen years old. He
had a fresh, ruddy face, and was strong and
full of courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>

<p class="caption"><i>View of West Point from Port Putnam.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The fourth-class men at this school were
called by their school-mates &ldquo;plebs,&rdquo; and
were made to sweep and scrub the barracks
and to do other tasks of the same kind.
The third-class men would play pranks upon
the new boys, some of which were quite hard
to bear. Now, when they saw this country
boy in his home-spun clothes, they thought
that they would have rare sport out of him.
But such were his courage and good temper
that they soon let him alone.</p>
<p>He now studied hard, for, being behind
his class, he had double work to do. He
once said to a friend that he studied very
hard for what he learned at West Point.</p>
<p>Just as when he was a boy, if he did not
understand the lesson of the day, he would
not pass over it to the next, but would work
on until he knew all about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It was often the case that when called to
the black-board to recite, he would say that
he was still at work on the last lesson. This,
of course, caused him to get low marks, but
he was too honest to pretend to know what
he did not understand at all. His teachers
judged his mind sound and strong, but not
quick. What he lacked in quickness, he
made up in steady work; so, at the end of
the fourth year, he graduated seventeenth in
his class.</p>
<p>During the second year at West Point, he
grew, as it were, by a leap to the height of
six feet; and in his cadet uniform was very
fine-looking.</p>
<p>He was neat in his attire, and kept his
gun clean and bright.</p>
<p>It is said that one day during this year, he
found that his bright musket had been stolen,
and that a foul and rusty one had been put
into its place.</p>
<p>He told the captain of his loss, and gave
him a mark by which his gun might be
known. That evening it was found in the
hands of a fellow-cadet who had stolen it
and then told a falsehood to shield himself
from punishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Jackson had been angry because of his
musket, but now he was deeply vexed at the
falsehood, and asked that the cadet should
be sent away, as he was unfit to remain at
the academy. The friends of the boy at
last prevailed upon him to waive his right of
pressing the charge, and the erring cadet was
let alone. Not long after, the cadet again
broke the rules of the school and was sent
away in disgrace.</p>
<p>From this we see that Jackson had at
that time a hatred of all that was low and
wicked.</p>
<p>He now wrote, in a blank book, a number
of maxims as rules for his life. They
touched on morals, manners, dress, the
choice of friends, and the aims of life. One
of these rules every boy should keep in mind.
It was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be whatever you resolve to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shall see that this was indeed the
guiding star of his life. Whatever he willed to
do he always did by sheer force of endeavor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>At this time it is plain that it was his
purpose to place his name high up on the
roll of earthly honor. Beneath his shy and
modest manners, there burned the wish to be
truly great. His life was not yet ruled by
love of Christ, but it shows some of the
highest and noblest aims.</p>
<p>Jackson was twenty-two years old when
he left West Point, June 30, 1846. He
then took the rank of second lieutenant of
artillery in the United States army. The
artillery is that branch of an army which
fights with cannon, or big guns. At that
time a war was going on between the United
States and Mexico. General Scott was then
going to the seat of war to take the chief
command of the army of the United States:
and Jackson, the young lieutenant, was sent
to join him in the south of Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Major of Artillery.</span></h2>
<p>On the 9th day of March, 1847, thirteen
thousand five hundred troops were landed in
one day from the American fleet upon the
sea-shore near Vera Cruz (V&#257;-r&auml; Kroos).</p>
<p>This fine army, with its waving flags and
bright guns, presented a scene of splendor
which Lieutenant Jackson never forgot.</p>
<p>General Scott&rsquo;s plan was to take the city
of Vera Cruz by storm, and then march over
the hills and valleys and lofty mountains to
the City of Mexico.</p>
<p>This was a hard task, and cost many lives,
as I will show you.</p>
<p>On the 13th of March, General Scott had
placed his men all around the city of Vera
Cruz and was ready for battle. On the 29th
of March, after a fierce battle, the city was
taken by the Americans. This was the first
battle in which our hero took part, and it is
said that he fought bravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="800" />
<p class="caption"><i>Bird&rsquo;s-Eye View of City of Mexico.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>From Vera Cruz, the army marched on
until it came to a mountain, on the crest of
which was the strong fort of Cerro Gordo
(S&#277;r&prime;-r&#333; G&ocirc;r&prime;-d&#333;). Here, our troops were led
by Captain Robert E. Lee, of the engineers,
over a rough road planned by him, to the
rear of the Mexicans. The Americans being
in front of the Mexicans and also behind
them, the latter were soon put to flight,
leaving many men and guns on the battlefield.</p>
<p>After this battle, Jackson was placed in
the light artillery, which used small cannon
and moved rapidly from place to place.</p>
<p>This change was just what young Jackson
wished, for though more dangerous, the light
artillery service gave him a better chance to
win the honors for which his soul thirsted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Santa Anna, the general of the Mexicans,
now brought forward another large army and
placed it on the mountain heights of
Cherubus&prime;co. Here, a fierce fight took place,
and the Mexicans were again driven back.</p>
<p>As a reward for his brave conduct in this
fight, our hero was given the brevet rank of
captain of artillery. The army then marched
on over the mountains to the strong castle
of Chapultepec (Ch&auml;-pool&prime;-t&#257;-p&#277;k&prime;). This castle
was built upon a high hill guarding the
plain which led to the City of Mexico. The
level plain at the foot of the mountain was
covered with crops of corn and other grain,
and with groves of trees. Here and there
were deep and wide ditches which the farmers
had dug for drains. These ditches the
artillery and horsemen could not cross; in
fact, the growing crops so concealed them
that the men could not see them until they
had reached their brinks.</p>
<p>Within the castle of Chapultepec were
swarms of Mexican soldiers, while around its
base were cannon, so placed as to sweep
every road that led up to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>On the 13th of September the assault was
made on three sides at the same time. Jackson
was sent with his men and guns to the
northwest side. Two regiments of infantry,
or footmen, marched with him.</p>
<p>They pushed forward, pouring shot and
shell at the foe, until they were quite close
to their guns, and at so short a range that
Jackson in a few moments found a number
of his horses killed and his men struck down
or scattered by the storm of grapeshot.</p>
<p>Just at this time, General Worth, seeing
how closely Jackson was pressed, sent him
word to fall back. Jackson, however, replied
that if General Worth would send him fifty
more men he would march forward and take
the guns which had done such deadly work.</p>
<p>While the troops were coming up, it is said
that Jackson lifted a gun by hand across a
deep ditch, and began to fire upon the Mexicans
with the help of only one man, the rest
of his command being either killed, wounded,
or hidden in the ditch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<div class="img" id="pic6">

<p class="caption"><i>Jackson moving cannon across a ditch.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Soon another cannon was moved across
the ditch, and in a few moments the foe
was driven back by the rapid firing of these
two guns.</p>
<p>By this time, the men storming the castle
on the other two sides had fought their way
in, and the Mexicans began to fall back
upon the City of Mexico.</p>
<p>Orders had been given that when this
move took place, the artillery must move forward
rapidly and scatter the ranks of the foe.
In an instant Jackson&rsquo;s guns were thundering
after the Mexicans, fleeing through the
gates into the city.</p>
<p>The next morning, September 14th, the
gates were forced and the Americans marched
into the city of Mexico.</p>
<p>For his brave conduct in the battle of
Chapultepec, Jackson was raised to the rank
of major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>In after years, when he was modestly telling
of this battle, a young man cried out,
&ldquo;Major, why did you not run when so many
of your men and horses were killed?&rdquo; He
replied, with a quiet smile, &ldquo;I was not
ordered to do so. If I had been <i>ordered</i> to
run I should have done so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="Portrait" width="500" height="617" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Once, when asked by a friend if he felt no
fear when so many were falling around him,
he said that he felt only a great desire to
perform some brave deed that would win for
him lasting fame. At that time, his thoughts
were chiefly fixed upon the faithful performance
of his duty, and gaining honor and
distinction thereby.</p>
<p>In the beautiful City of Mexico, the American
army now rested from warfare. Some
months passed before Jackson&rsquo;s command
was ordered home. His duties being light,
he began the study of the Spanish language,
and was soon able to speak it well. He
greatly enjoyed the fine climate of Mexico, and
admired the beauty and grace of her women.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, he began to
think of religion and to study the Bible in
search of the truth.</p>
<p>On May 26th, 1848, a treaty of peace was
made between the United States and Mexico,
and the war being over, the American troops
were sent home.</p>
<p>Major Jackson&rsquo;s command was sent to
Fort Hamilton, about seven miles from the
city of New York. While there, he was baptized
and admitted to his first communion

<p>After he had been at Fort Hamilton two
years, Major Jackson was sent to Fort
Meade, near Tampa Bay, on the west coast
of Florida. While at this place, on the 28th
of March, 1851, he was elected professor of
natural and experimental philosophy and
artillery tactics in the Military Institute at
Lexington, Virginia.</p>

<p>In writing of Major Jackson as a professor,
it seems highly appropriate to mention
the circumstances leading to his appointment
to that position.</p>

<p>Reared in adverse circumstances, which
prevented him in early youth from receiving
the benefits of a good common-school education,
by his own efforts, mainly, he fitted
himself to enter the United States Military
Academy at West Point. His first year&rsquo;s
course would have discouraged him in prosecuting
his studies had he not been conscious
that there was that within, which, if properly
nurtured, would lead to ultimate success.
In his second year, he raised his general
standing from 51 to 30; in the third, from
30 to 20, and in the fourth, his graduating
year, from 20 to 17. His upward progress
attracted attention, and one of his associates
remarked: &ldquo;Had Jackson remained at West
Point upon a course of four years&rsquo; longer
study, he would have reached the head of his
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His advancement in the Mexican war,
rising rapidly from brevet second lieutenant
of artillery to brevet major, was no less
marked than that at the academy, and his
gallant and meritorious services had been
heralded to the world through the official
reports of his superiors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>General Francis H. Smith, superintendent
of the Virginia Military Institute, in &ldquo;Institute
Memorial,&rdquo; writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not surprising that, when the Board
of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute
were looking about for a suitable person to
fill the chair of Natural and Experimental
Philosophy and Artillery, the associates of
this young and brave major of artillery
should have pointed him out as worthy to
receive so distinguished an honor. Other
names had been submitted to the Board of
Visitors by the Faculty of West Point, all of
men distinguished for high scholarship and
for gallant services in Mexico. McClellan,
Reno, Rosecrans, afterward generals in the
Northern army, and G. W. Smith, who afterward
became a general in the Confederate
army, were thus named. But the peculiar
fitness of young Jackson, the high testimonials
to his personal character, and his
nativity as a Virginian, satisfied the Board
that they might safely select him for the
vacant chair without seeking candidates
from other States. He was, therefore, unanimously
elected to the professorship on the
28th of March, 1851, and entered upon the
duties of his chair on the 1st of September
following.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;The professorial career of Major Jackson
was marked by great faithfulness, and by an
unobtrusive, yet earnest spirit. With high
mental endowments, <i>teaching</i> was a new profession
to him, and demanded, in the important
department of instruction assigned to
him, an amount of labor which, from the
state of his health, and especially from the
weakness of his eyes, he rendered at great
sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conscientious fidelity to duty marked
every step of his life here, and when called
to active duty in the field he had made considerable
progress in the preparation of an
elementary work on optics, which he proposed
to publish for the benefit of his classes.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strict, and at times stern, in his discipline,
though ever polite and kind, he was not
always a popular professor; but no professor
ever possessed to a higher degree the confidence
and respect of the cadets for his
unbending integrity and fearlessness in the
discharge of his duty. If he was exact in
his demands upon them, they knew he was
no less so in his own respect for and submission
to authority; and, thus, it became a
proverb among them, that it was useless to
write an excuse for a report made by Major
Jackson. His great principle of government
was, that <i>a general rule should not be violated
for any particular good</i>; and his animating
rule of action was, that <i>a man could always
accomplish what he willed to perform</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punctual to a minute, I have known him
to walk in front of the superintendent&rsquo;s
quarters in a hard rain, because the hour had
not quite arrived when it was his duty to
present his weekly class reports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;For ten years, he prosecuted his unwearied
labors as a professor, making during this
period, in no questionable form, such an
impress upon those who from time to time
were under his command, that, when the
war broke out, the spontaneous sentiment of
all cadets and graduates was, <i>to serve under
him as their leader</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An incident is related by General Smith
in the same work, which shows clearly how
Jackson was looked upon in the community
in which he resided:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left the Virginia Military Institute
on the 21st of April, 1861, in command of
the corps of cadets, and reported for duty
at Camp Lee, Richmond. Dangers were
thickening rapidly around the State. Invasion
by overwhelming numbers seemed imminent.
Norfolk, Richmond, Alexandria, and
Harper&rsquo;s Ferry were threatened. Officers
were needed to command at these points.
The Governor of Virginia nominated Major
Jackson as a colonel of volunteers. His
nomination was immediately and unanimously
confirmed by the Council of State,
and sent to the Convention then in session.
Some prejudice existed in that body from
the supposed influence of the Virginia Military
Institute in these appointments, and
the question was asked by various members,
&lsquo;Who is this Thomas J. Jackson&rsquo;? A member
of the Convention from the county of Rockbridge,
Hon. S. McDowell Moore, replied:
&lsquo;I can tell you who he is. <i>If you put Jackson
in command at Norfolk, he will never
leave it alive unless you order him to do so.</i>&rsquo;
Such was the impress made upon his neighbors
and friends in his quiet life as a professor
at the Military Institute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>In accepting the position of professor, he
was again stepping higher. In active warfare
an officer may advance rapidly, but in
times of peace he lives quietly at a military
post and simply rusts out. Ill-health, brought
on mainly by exposure in the Mexican War,
caused Major Jackson to resign his commission
in the army; but in all probability, had
this not been the case he would have abandoned
army life, because he felt that by
close study and application, he could reach
a much higher degree of mental excellence
than he had attained; and the position of
professor would enable him to do this, for he
knew that the best way to learn was to
teach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>In consequence of the weakness of his
eyes, his great will-power had now to be
exerted to the utmost, because he could not
use his eyes at night. In order to do himself
and his classes justice, each morning after
class hours, he would carefully read over the
lessons for the next day, and, at night after
his simple supper, he would quietly sit with
his face to the wall and go over in his mind
the lessons read that day. In this way he
made them his own, and was prepared to
teach the next day. This training was of
great use to him in his after life as a soldier.
The power of his mind was such that while
riding, in later years, at the head of his army,
he could study the movements of the foe, and
plan his own with as much care and skill as
in the quiet of his study at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The statement made by General Smith
respecting the desire of the cadets to serve
under Major Jackson in the war shows how
popular he was, and this estimate of his
powers could have been produced only by
their knowledge of his great worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo; was the name given to the
Major by the cadets, but it was never used
derisively. Pranks were played in Major
Jackson&rsquo;s section room by the cadets, but
more for their own amusement than for any
other purpose. They well knew the consequences
if caught, but were willing to run
the risk for the sake of fun.</p>
<p>Cadet Abe Fulkerson once wore a collar
made out of three fourths of a yard of linen,
(for no other purpose than to produce a laugh)
and it made even &ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo; laugh&mdash;that
is, smile, which he would not have done if
the size, shape, or color of collars had been
fixed by the Institute regulations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Cadet Davidson Penn, with an uncommonly
solemn face and apparently in good
faith, once asked Major Jackson, &ldquo;Major, can
a cannon be so bent as to make it shoot
around a corner?&rdquo; The Major showed not
the slightest sign of impatience or of merriment,
but after a moment of apparently
sober thought, replied, &ldquo;Mr. Penn, I reckon
hardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said that Major Jackson never
smiled or laughed. It has just been shown
that he smiled <i>once</i>, and there is no doubt
but that if he could have been seen when he
read the excuse mentioned below, not only
would another smile have been seen, but a
good, hearty laugh heard. At artillery drill
one evening Major Jackson had given the
command, &ldquo;Limbers and caissons pass your
pieces, trot, march!&rdquo; Cadet Hambrick failed
to <i>trot</i> at command and was reported. The
next day the following excuse was handed
in: Report, &ldquo;Cadet Hambrick not trotting
at artillery drill.&rdquo; Excuse, &ldquo;I am a natural
pacer.&rdquo; These three incidents are recounted
by Dr. J. C. Hiden, of Richmond, Virginia.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Professor Jackson&rsquo;s Class-room, Virginia Military Institute.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Cadet Thos. B. Amiss, who was afterwards
surgeon of one of Jackson&rsquo;s Georgian regiments,
tried a prank for the double purpose
of evading a recitation and creating a laugh.
He was squad-marcher of his section, and
after calling the roll and making his report
to the officer of the day, he turned the section
over to the next man on the roll, took his
place in ranks, and cautioned the new squad-marcher
not to report him absent. While
the squad-marcher was making his report
to Major Jackson whose eyes seemed always
riveted to his class-book when this was being
done, Amiss noiselessly climbed to the
top of a column that stood nearly in the
center of the room. Having received the
report, Major Jackson commenced to call the
names of those whom he wished to recite
at the board, commencing with Amiss; not
hearing Amiss respond, he asked, &ldquo;Mr.
Amiss absent?&rdquo; The squad-marcher replied,
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; The Major looked steadily
along the line of faces, seemed perplexed
and cast his eyes upwards, when he spied
the delinquent at the top of the column.
The Major, for a moment, gazed at the
clinging figure and said, &ldquo;You stay there,&rdquo;
and Amiss had to remain where he was
until the recitation was over. He was
reported, court-martialed, received the maximum
number of demerits, and had a large
number of extra tours of guard duty assigned
him, during the walking of which
in the lone hours of the night, he had ample
time to repent of his folly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>When the class that graduated in 1860
commenced its recitations under Major Jackson,
a sudden end was made to all kinds of
merriment in his class-room. A member of
the class, who is now a member of Congress
from Virginia, concealed a small music-box
under his coatee and carried it into the
class-room. After the recitation had commenced
he touched a spring and the room
was filled with sweet, muffled strains of
music. Major Jackson did not hear, or if
he did, took no notice of it. The cadet, finding
that his music was not duly appreciated,
commenced to bark, in very low tones, like a
puppy, and this meeting with the same fate
as the music he became emboldened and
barked louder. Major Jackson, without
changing his countenance, turning his head,
or raising his voice above an ordinary tone,
said, &ldquo;Mr. C., when you march the section
in again, please leave that puppy outside.&rdquo;
The laugh was on the young cadet, and the
result stated followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The following incident illustrates clearly
how regardless Major Jackson was of public
opinion or personal feeling when in conflict
with duty. A young cadet was dismissed
through a circumstance that occurred in
Major Jackson&rsquo;s class-room, and he became
so enraged that he challenged the Major to
fight a duel, and sent him word that if he
would not fight he would kill him on sight.
Major Jackson, actuated solely by conscientious
motives, took the necessary precautions
to prevent a conflict, and informed the young
man, through his friends, that if he were
attacked he would defend himself. The
attack was not made, notwithstanding the
fact that the Major passed back and forth as
usual. This cadet, during the Civil War,
learned to know Major Jackson better, was
under his command, and before the close of
the war commanded the &ldquo;Stonewall Brigade,&rdquo;
which was rendered so famous by
Jackson; and in later years, when asked his
opinion of this great man, said that he was
the only man ever born who had never been
whipped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Major Jackson seemed to enjoy the duty
of drilling the artillery battery more than
any other duty he had to perform, and it
was natural that he should, for he had won
fame as an artillery officer in the Mexican
War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Where Major Jackson trained artillerymen (Virginia Military Institute Parade-Grounds).</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Near the close of every session of the Institute,
Major Jackson was required to drill
the battery before the Board of Visitors; and
in order to make it more interesting to the
public, always present in large crowds, blank
cartridges were fired, and the drill had really
the semblance of a battery in actual battle.
An impressive scene was witnessed at this
drill in 1860. It commenced at 5 P. M.
Major Jackson had put the battery through
its various evolutions, and as the time approached
for the firing to commence, seemed
more and more interested in his work. His
old professor of engineering at West Point,
Dennis Mahan, and the commandant of cadets
of that institution, Colonel Hardee, witnessed
the drill. Ever since the commencement of
the evolutions, a dark cloud had been gathering
in the west and the rumbling of thunder
could be heard. The firing commenced and
all was excitement. Closer and closer came
the cloud, and the artillery of heaven seemed
replying to the discharges of the battery.
Major Jackson had been slowly retreating
before the imaginary foe, firing by half battery.
The cloud came nearer and nearer,
unheeded by Jackson. Suddenly his voice
rang clear and sharp, &ldquo;Fire advancing
by half battery&rdquo;&mdash;the foe were retreating&mdash;&ldquo;right-half
battery advance, commence
firing!&rdquo; New positions were rapidly taken,
and the firing was at its height. Then the
storm broke in all its fury. Up to that time
the Major had seemed oblivious to all save
the drill. The bursting storm brought him
to himself and he dismissed the battery,
which at once went to shelter. Major Jackson
remained where he was, folded his arms
and stood like a statue in the driving storm.
An umbrella was sent him from a house
close by with an invitation to come to cover.
He replied, &ldquo;No, thank you;&rdquo; and there he
stood until the storm was over, doubtless
thinking of the hard-fought fields of Mexico
and the havoc he had there wrought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>In November, 1851, Major Jackson connected
himself with the Presbyterian church
at Lexington, then in charge of the Rev. Dr.
W. S. White. It now seemed his chief
desire to do good. He was made a deacon
and given a class of young men in the Sunday
school. Some of them still live and
remember how faithfully he taught them.
He also gathered together the African slaves
of the town every Sabbath evening for the
purpose of teaching them the truths of the
Bible. He soon had a school of eighty or a
hundred pupils and twelve teachers. This
school he kept up from 1855 to 1861, when
he left Lexington to enter the army; and
until his death it was always a great pleasure
to him to hear of his black Sunday school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Duty became now more than ever the
rule of his life&mdash;duty to God and duty to
man. So great was his regard for the Sabbath
that he would not even read a letter,
or mail one which he knew would be carried
on that day.</p>
<p>The Rev. R. L. Dabney tells us that one
Sabbath, when a dear friend, who knew that
the Major had received a letter from his lady-love
late on Saturday night, asked, as they
were walking to church, &ldquo;Major, surely you
have read your letter?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;What obstinacy!&rdquo; exclaimed his friend.
&ldquo;Do you not think that your desire to know
its contents will distract your mind from
divine worship far more than if you had
done with reading it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered
he, quietly, &ldquo;I shall make the most faithful
effort I can to control my thoughts, and as I
do this from a sense of duty, I shall expect
the divine blessing upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>When a single man, he made it a rule to
accept, if possible, all invitations, saying
that when a friend had taken the trouble to
invite him it was his duty to attend.</p>
<p>Major Gittings, once a cadet, and a relative
of Major Jackson, says: &ldquo;Speaking from
a social standpoint, no man ever had a more
delicate regard for the feelings of others than
he, and nothing would embarrass him more
than any <i>contretemps</i> that might occur to
cause pain or distress of mind to others.
Hence, he was truly a polite man, and while
his manner was often constrained, and even
awkward, yet he would usually make a
favorable impression, through his desire to
please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>When Major Jackson first came to Lexington
he was in ill-health, and many things he
did were looked upon as odd, which were
really not so. He had been at a famous
water-cure hospital in the North, and had
been ordered to live on stale bread and buttermilk
and to wear a wet shirt next to his
body. He was also advised to go to bed at
9 o&rsquo;clock. If that hour found him at a party
or lecture, or any other place, in order to
obey his physician, he would leave.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">

<p class="caption"><i>Major Jackson&rsquo;s Home in Lexington.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The dyspepsia with which he suffered
often caused drowsiness, and he would sometimes
go to sleep while talking to a friend
or while sitting in his pew at church.</p>
<p>General Hill says of him: &ldquo;I have seen
his head bowed down to his very knees
during a good part of the sermon. He
always heard the text of our good pastor,
the Rev. Dr. White, and the first part of
the sermon, but after that all was lost.&rdquo;
Before leaving Lexington, he seemed to have
gained complete control over his muscles,
even while asleep, for no one, in the few
years preceding his departure, ever saw &ldquo;his
head and his knees in contact,&rdquo; but it was
a common thing to see him sound asleep
while sitting perfectly upright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Before marriage, Major Jackson had his
room in barracks, but took his meals at a
hotel in Lexington, and it has been said by
some that his eccentricities caused much
comment; more than that, he was laughed at
and insulted by rude, coarse persons. This
could hardly have been true, for an insult
offered to &ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo; would certainly have
been found out in some way, and if not resented
personally, it would have been by the
cadets to a man. One who lived in Lexington
during four years of Major Jackson&rsquo;s residence
there, and more than a quarter of a
century after the war, never heard of these
insults, and, surely, had they ever been given
they would have been talked of, for Jackson&rsquo;s
name was on every tongue, and the incidents
of his life, from boyhood to death, were
almost a constant subject of conversation.</p>
<p>Though Major Jackson was very modest,
no man ever relied more fully upon himself.
Mentioning one day to a friend that he was
going to begin the study of Latin, he received
the reply that one who had not studied the
forms of that language in youth could never
become master of it in later years. To this
Jackson replied, &ldquo;No; if I attempt it, I shall
become master of the language. <i>I can do
what I will to do.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>This stern will-power came to the aid of
his ambition many times. He found it difficult
to speak in public, and in order to acquire
the art, he joined a literary club called
the &ldquo;Franklin Society.&rdquo; He was always at
the meetings, and spoke in his turn; but, at
first, his efforts were painful both to himself
and to his hearers. His health was poor, his
nerves were unstrung, and sometimes he was
so confused that he would break down in the
middle of a sentence for want of the right
word. When this happened, he would quietly
sit down, and when his turn in the debate
came again would rise and make another attempt.
Thus, before the close of the debate,
he would succeed in telling what was in his
mind. By thus trying time after time, he became
a good speaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Soon after joining the Presbyterian church,
good Dr. White, his pastor, called upon him
to pray in public. He prayed in such a
halting way that Dr. White told him that he
would never again ask him to perform so
hard a task. Major Jackson replied that it
was a cross to him to pray in public, but
that he had made up his mind to bear it,
and did not wish to be excused. So he kept
on trying, and soon became a leader in
prayer.</p>
<p>General Hill, speaking of this incident,
says: &ldquo;I think his conduct in this case was
due to his determination to conquer every
weakness of his nature. He once told me
that when he was a small boy, being sick, a
mustard plaster was placed upon his chest,
and his guardian mounted him upon a horse
to go to a neighbor&rsquo;s house, so that his mind
might be diverted and the plaster kept on.
He said that the pain was so dreadful that
he fainted soon after getting off his horse.
I asked him if he had kept it on in order to
obey his guardian. He answered, &lsquo;No, it
was owing to a feeling that I have had from
childhood not to yield to trials and difficulties.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The same close friend also writes: &ldquo;Dr.
Dabney thinks that he was timid, and that
nothing but his iron will made him brave.
I think this is a mistake. The muscles of
his face would twitch when a battle was
about to open, and his hand would tremble
so that he could hardly write. His men
would see the working of his face and would
say, &lsquo;Old Jack is making faces at the Yankees.&rsquo;
But all this only showed weak nerves.
I think he loved danger for its own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like St. Paul, &ldquo;he kept his body under,&rdquo;
and would not let any appetite control him or
any weakness overcome him. He used neither
coffee, tobacco, nor spirits, and he would go
all winter without cloak or overcoat in the
mountains of Virginia, giving as a reason
that he &ldquo;did not wish to give way to cold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>For a like reason, he never drank spirits
of any kind. It is told of him that once
during the Civil War, when he was too near
the outposts of the foe to have fire, and
being greatly chilled, he was advised by his
surgeon to take a drink of brandy. He at
length agreed to take some, but made such a
wry face in swallowing it that some one
asked him if it choked him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;I like it. That is the reason I never
use it.&rdquo; Another time, being asked to take
a drink of brandy, he said, &ldquo;No, I thank
you; I am more afraid of it than all the
Federal bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal Jackson afraid of strong
drink! What a lesson to people who have
not the courage to say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when tempted
to do wrong!</p>
<p>In the midst of this busy life as professor,
Major Jackson was married, on August 4th,
1853, to Miss Eleanor Junkin, the daughter
of the president of Washington College, Lexington,
Virginia. This lovely lady lived only
fourteen months after her marriage. Major
Jackson&rsquo;s grief at her death was so great as
to alarm his friends. His health, never good,
suffered seriously, and his friends induced
him in the summer of 1856 to take a trip
to Europe, hoping that &ldquo;the spell might be
broken which bound him to sadness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>His European trip benefited him very
materially in health and spirits, and on his
return he, with great zeal, resumed his
labors in his classes at both the Military
Institute and the Sunday School.</p>
<p>He had started on his return trip in ample
time to reach the Institute at its opening,
September 1st, which he had promised to do;
but storms had prevented this and he was
behind time.</p>
<p>A lady friend, knowing what a slave he
was to his word, asked him if he had not
been miserable at the delay. The answer
was characteristic of the man. He had
done his part, Providence had intervened,
and he had not worried in the least. No
man ever trusted Providence more implicitly
than Jackson, and when he went to God in
prayer he knew that his feet would be guided
in the right way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Dr. Dabney tells us that one day, when a
friend said that he could not understand
how one could &ldquo;pray without ceasing,&rdquo; Jackson
replied that he had, for some time, been
in the habit of praying all through the day.
&ldquo;When we take our meals,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there
is grace, and when I take a draught of water,
I always pause to lift up my heart to God
in thanks for the &lsquo;water of life&rsquo;; and when
I go to my class-room and await the coming
of the cadets, that is my time to pray for
them. And so with every other act of the
day.&rdquo; Thus we see that Jackson was truly
a &ldquo;praying man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pastor, Rev. Dr. White, once said that
Major Jackson was the happiest man that
he had ever known. This happiness came
from his faith in the saving care of God.</p>
<p>We are told that a friend once said to him,
&ldquo;Suppose you should lose your eyesight and
then, too, be very ill, and have to depend on
those bound to you by no tie, would not
this be too much for your faith? Do you
think you could be happy then?&rdquo; He
thought a moment and then said, &ldquo;If it
were the will of God to place me on a sick
bed, He would enable me to lie there in
peace a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Such was the faith of this great man!
As he grew older his spirit became more
saintly until, when called upon to go up
higher to meet his Lord, his end seemed
more like a passing over than a death.</p>
<p>Major Jackson was married again, on July
15th, 1857, to Mary Anna Morrison, the
daughter of Dr. R. H. Morrison, a Presbyterian
minister, of North Carolina. This lady
is now living, and has quite lately written a
life of her husband, in which she gives beautiful
glimpses of their home life in Lexington,
and also extracts from his letters written to
her during the Civil War, of which I must
so soon tell you.</p>
<p>Shortly after his second marriage, Major
Jackson bought a house and a few acres of
land, and soon all of his spare time was
spent in working in his garden and fields.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>We are told that his little farm of rocky
hill-land was soon well fenced and tilled, and
that he used to say that the bread grown
there by the labor of himself and slaves
tasted sweeter than that which was bought.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Mrs. T. J. Jackson in 1899.</i></p>
</div>
<p>He liked to have his friends visit him, and
nowhere else was he so easy and happy as
with his guests at his own table.</p>
<p>In his home, military sternness left his
brow and the law of love took its place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>This story is told of him, which shows how
gentle and tender a soldier may be. &ldquo;Once
a friend, who was taking his little four-year-old
girl on a journey without her mother,
called on the way to spend the night with
Major Jackson. At bed-time, when Mrs.
Jackson wished to take the child to her
room for the night, the father replied that
his little one would give less trouble if he
kept her with him. In the still watches of
the night, he heard a soft step, and felt a
hand laid upon his bed. It was Major Jackson,
who, fearing that the little girl would
toss off the covering, had come to see that
all was safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This good and peaceful life at Lexington
was short. The black cloud of war was
hovering over our land and ere long the
storm burst in great fury, sweeping Major
Jackson away from his quiet life, his professorial
duties, and his loved wife and
friends, into the midst of carnage and death,
and to deeds that made his fame world-wide
and immortal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Major Jackson had but one more duty to
perform as a professor and officer of the Virginia
Military Institute. He had been left
in charge of the corps of cadets when the
superintendent had been called to Richmond.
Early on the morning of Sunday, April 21st,
1861, an order was received by Major Jackson
from Governor John Letcher, directing
him to leave with his command for Richmond
at 12:30 P. M. that day. Major
Jackson&rsquo;s arrangements were promptly made,
and he sent a request to his pastor, good
Dr. White, to come to the Institute and hold
religious services for the young men prior to
their departure. These services were held
in front of the barracks. The battalion was
drawn up in line of battle, Major Jackson
at the head and venerable Dr. White in the
front and center. All, with bowed heads,
were devoutly listening to the invocations
speeding heavenward. The clock in the
Institute tower gave the signal for departure,
and, without a moment&rsquo;s pause, Jackson took
up the line of march and left his beloved
pastor praying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The key-note of his great success as a soldier
was prompt obedience to orders and
requiring the same of others.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Confederate Colonel.</span></h2>
<p>Before going on with the life of our hero,
I must tell you, in a few plain and truthful
words, the causes of the Civil War which in
1861 broke out between the States.</p>
<p>You remember that, after the Revolutionary
War, the thirteen colonies agreed to form
a Union, and adopted a set of laws called the
Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>From the very first, however, the States
did not agree; in fact, laws which suited
one section did not suit the other, so that
there was always some cause for a quarrel.</p>
<p>At last, the question of slavery seemed to
give the most trouble. You have been told
that African slaves were first brought to Virginia
in 1619 by the Dutch, and that afterwards
English and Northern traders brought
others, until all of the colonies held slaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The cold climate of the North did not suit
the negroes, who had been used to the hot
sun of Africa. So, by degrees, they were
sold to Southern planters.</p>
<p>Many influential men North and South
wished to see the slaves freed. But, as the
slaves increased in the South, Southern
men saw that a rapid abolition of slavery
would be disastrous to both whites and
blacks, because the negroes were not ready
for it. As slavery decreased in the North,
many Northern people did not realize this.
Besides, the North did not wish slave labor
to compete with the free labor of the North.</p>
<p>The North insisted that slaves should not
be brought into the new States as they came
into the Union. The South demanded that
a slave-holder should be free to carry his
slaves from one State into another.</p>
<p>Many Southern people also believed that
the negroes were the happiest and best cared
for working people in the world, and that the
North was trespassing upon their just rights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>So the quarrel went on until October, 1859,
when an event happened in Virginia which
greatly increased the hatred of both parties.
A man named John Brown laid a plot for
freeing the negroes, first in Virginia and
then in the whole South.</p>
<p>For two years, he sent men through the
South secretly to stir up the negroes and incite
them to kill the whites. He bought long
iron pikes for the negroes to fight with, as
they did not know how to use fire-arms.</p>
<p>When he thought that all was ready, he
entered Harper&rsquo;s Ferry by night, with only
eighteen men, and seized the arsenal there,
sending out armed men into the country to
capture the principal slave-owners and to
call upon the slaves to join him. This was
done secretly during the night, and the next
morning every white man who left his home
was seized, and imprisoned in an engine-house
near the arsenal. Only a few negroes
came in, and they were too much scared to
aid in the deadly and dastardly work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>As soon as the news of this raid spread
over the country, angry men came into town
from all sides, and before night John Brown
and his men were shut up in the engine-house.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic13">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="630" />
<p class="caption"><i>Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, Virginia.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Soon a band of marines, under the command
of Colonel R. E. Lee, was sent out
from Washington by the Government, and
as John Brown would not surrender, the
soldiers at once stormed the engine-house.
Ten of John Brown&rsquo;s men were killed by the
soldiers, and all the rest, including Brown
himself, were wounded. Six of the storming
party were killed and nine wounded.
John Brown and seven of his men were
brought to trial at Charles Town, Virginia,
and being found guilty of treason, were
hanged.</p>
<p>The cadets of the Virginia Military Institute
were ordered to Charles Town to protect
the officers of the law. Major Jackson commanded
a section of light artillery accompanying
the battalion, and was present at
the death of Brown. He afterwards gave
his friends a graphic account of this dreadful
scene.</p>
<p>This event cast great gloom over the
country. Many persons at the North thought
that John Brown had died a martyr to the
cause of slavery, while the people at the
South saw that they could no longer enjoy
in peace and safety the rights granted to
them by the Constitution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Major Jackson was truly Southern in feeling.
He believed in the &ldquo;Rights of States&rdquo;
and also that the South ought to take her
stand and resent all efforts to coerce and
crush her. He, however, dreaded war and
thought it the duty of Christians throughout
the land to pray for peace.</p>
<p>A month before South Carolina went out
of the Union, Major Jackson called upon his
pastor, Dr. White, and said: &ldquo;It is painful to
know how carelessly they speak of war. If the
Government insists upon the measures now
threatened, there must be war. They seem
not to know what its horrors are. Let us
have meetings to pray for peace.&rdquo; Dr. White
agreed to his request, and the burden of
Major Jackson&rsquo;s prayer was that God would
preserve the land from war.</p>
<p>After the election of Mr. Lincoln, in November,
1860, to be President of the United
States, the Southern States saw no hope of
getting their rights and resolved to secede,
or withdraw from the Union of the States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>South Carolina took the lead and seceded
on the 20th of December, 1860. She was
quickly followed by Mississippi, Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.</p>
<p>On the 9th of January, 1861, these States
united and at Montgomery, in Alabama,
formed a government called &ldquo;The Confederate
States of America,&rdquo; with Jefferson Davis
as President.</p>
<p>Virginia was slow to withdraw from the
Union formed by the States; but, when President
Lincoln called for seventy-five thousand
soldiers to invade the Southern States, she
delayed no longer. On April 17th, 1861, she
seceded and began to prepare for war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one week,&rdquo; says Dabney, &ldquo;the whole
State was changed into a camp.&rdquo; The sons
of Virginia rushed to arms, and soon the
city of Richmond was filled with men drilling
and preparing to fight.</p>
<p>At daybreak on Sunday morning, April
21st, 1861, an order came to Lexington from
the Governor of the State (Governor Letcher)
to march the cadets that day to Richmond.
As the senior officers were already in Richmond,
Major Jackson at once prepared to go
forward with his corps.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock A. M. he went to his
home to say good-bye to his wife. They
retired to their own room, where he read the
5th chapter of Second Corinthians, which
begins with these beautiful words: &ldquo;For we
know, if our earthly house of this tabernacle
be dissolved, we have a building of God, an
house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then knelt and prayed for themselves
and for their dear country, imploring God
that it might be His holy will to avert war
and bloodshed. He then said good-bye to
his wife and left his dear home, never more
to return to it. After a few days, his wife
went to live at the home of a friend&mdash;his
house was closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Major Jackson and the cadets marched
forward to Staunton, whence they went by
train to Richmond, and at once went into
camp on the Fair-Grounds.</p>
<p>From Richmond, Major Jackson wrote
thus to his wife: &ldquo;Colonel Lee, of the army,
is here and has been made Major-General of
the Virginia troops. I regard him a better
officer than General Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few days, on April 21st, Major Jackson
was made colonel of the Virginia forces
and ordered to take command at Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry, a town on the Potomac river where
the United States Government had had a
great number of workshops and fire-arms.
This important place had already been captured
by Virginia troops, and it was necessary
to hold it until the arms and machinery could
be moved away.</p>
<p>Just here it may be well to give you a
word-picture of our hero as he began a career
which was to fill the world with his fame.</p>

<div class="box">
<p><i>This is a copy of a Portrait I have
of my husband which I
consider the best likeness
extant Mrs. T. J. Jackson</i></p>
</div>
<p>Jackson was tall and very erect, with large
hands and feet. His brow was fair and
broad; his eyes were blue placid and clear
when their owner was calm, but dark and
flashing when he was aroused. His nose
was Roman, his cheeks ruddy, his mouth
firm, and his chin covered with a brown
beard. His step was long and rapid, and if
he was not a graceful rider, he was a fearless
one. In battle, or as he rode along his columns,
hat in hand, bowing right and left to
his soldiers, whose shouts arose on high, no
figure could be nobler than his. Few, even
of his intimate friends, were conscious of his
military genius, so he burst upon the world
as a meteor darts across a star-lit sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>On his way to Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, he wrote
thus to his dear wife:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Winchester</span>, April 29th, 1861.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to leave here about two P. M. to-day
for Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. I am thankful to say that an
ever-kind Providence, who causes &lsquo;all things to
work together for good to them that love Him,&rsquo;
has given me the post which I prefer above all
others. To His name be all the praise. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
You must not expect to hear from me very often,
as I shall have more work than I have ever had
in the same time before; but don&rsquo;t be troubled
about me, as an ever-kind Heavenly Father will
give me all needful aid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This letter,&rdquo; says a friend, &ldquo;gives a true
idea of his character. He feels within himself
the genius and power which make him
long to have a separate command; but he
also feels the need of resting upon his Heavenly
Father for aid and support.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Colonel Jackson had been ordered by Major-General
Lee to organize and drill the men
who had gathered at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry and to
hold the place as long as possible against
the foe.</p>
<p>He went to work with great zeal and, aided
by Colonel Maury and Major Preston, soon
had the men organized into companies and
regiments. As Colonel Jackson was known
to have been a brave soldier in the Mexican
War, he was readily obeyed by the soldiers
in his little army, which soon numbered
forty-five hundred men.</p>
<p>But on the 2nd of May, Virginia joined the
Southern Confederacy and handed over all of
her soldiers to that government, which bound
itself in return to defend Virginia and to pay
her troops.</p>
<p>General Joseph E. Johnston was sent on
the 23rd of May by the Confederate Government
to take command at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry
and Colonel Jackson at once gave up his
trust to General Johnston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The Virginia regiments at that place&mdash;the
Second, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Twenty-seventh,
and a little after, the Thirty-third,
with Pendleton&rsquo;s battery of light field-guns&mdash;were
now organized into a brigade, of which
Jackson was made the commander.
This was the brigade
which afterwards became
famous as the &ldquo;Stonewall
Brigade,&rdquo; and which, we shall
see, did much hard fighting,
and was to the Southern army
what the &ldquo;Tenth Legion&rdquo; was to the great
C&aelig;sar.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic16">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="531" />
<p class="caption"><i>Gen. J. E. Johnston.</i></p>
</div>
<p>General Johnston soon found out that he
could not hold Harper&rsquo;s Ferry against the foe
which was now coming up under General
Patterson. He, therefore, burnt the great railroad
bridge over the Potomac river at Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry and moved away all his guns and
stores; then on Sunday, June 16th, he withdrew
his little army to Bunker Hill, a place
about twelve miles from the city of Winchester.
There he offered battle to General Patterson,
but the latter refused to fight and
withdrew to the north bank of the Potomac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>On June 19th, Colonel Jackson was ordered
to march northward and watch the foe, who
was again crossing the river. He was also
ordered to destroy the engines and cars of the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad at Martinsburg.</p>
<p>This he did, though he writes of it in the
following words: &ldquo;It was a sad work; but
I had my orders, and my duty was to obey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until July 2nd, Colonel Jackson, with his
brigade, remained a little north of Martinsburg,
having in his front Colonel J. E. B.
Stuart with a regiment of cavalry. On that
day General Patterson advanced to meet
Jackson, who went forward with only one
regiment, the Fifth Virginia, a few companies
of cavalry, and one light field piece. A
sharp skirmish ensued. At last, the foe
coming up in large numbers, Jackson fell
back to the main body of his troops after
having taken forty-five prisoners, and killed
and wounded a large number of the enemy.
Jackson&rsquo;s loss was only two men killed and
ten wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>In this battle, which is known as that of
Haines&rsquo;s Farm, Colonel Jackson was, no
doubt, the only man in the infantry who
had ever been under fire, but they all
behaved with the greatest coolness and
bravery.</p>
<p>Jackson, in this first battle, showed such
boldness, and at the same time such care for
the lives of his men, that he at once gained
a hold upon their esteem.</p>
<p>General Patterson now held Martinsburg;
while General Johnston, having come up
with the whole army, offered him battle each
day. But Patterson had other plans, and
soon moved away.</p>
<p>While General Johnston was at Winchester
watching his movements, Colonel Jackson
received this note:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Richmond</span>, July 3rd, &rsquo;61.</span></p>

and to feel that you merit it. May your advancement
increase your usefulness to the State.</p>
<p><span class="center">Very truly,</span>
<span class="jr">R. E. LEE.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Jackson, for so we must now call
him, was much pleased at this promotion,
and wrote to his wife thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Through the blessing of God, I have now all
that I ought to wish in the line of promotion.
May His blessing rest on you is my fervent prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the spring of 1861, the States of
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas,
also left the Union and joined the new Confederacy,
the capital of which was now Richmond,
Virginia.</p>
<p>The great object of the North was to capture
Richmond. For this they raised four
large armies to invade Virginia. The first
was to go by way of Fortress Monroe; the
second, by way of Manassas; the third was
to march up the Shenandoah Valley; and the
fourth was to come from the northwest.</p>

</div>
<p>The North also was rich, because it had
the treasury of the United States, while the
South was poor in both money and arms,
and had the outside world closed against her.</p>
<p>So the Confederate leaders had to use
great skill in meeting such large armies with
so few men.</p>
<p>You remember that in the
last chapter I told how General
Johnston, at Winchester,
with a small force was watching
General Patterson. Now,
just across the mountains,
sixty miles southeast, at Manassas, Beauregard
(bo-re-gard), another famous Southern
general, was facing a large Northern army
under General McDowell. This army was
thirty-five thousand strong, while the Confederates
had only twenty-eight thousand
men. General McDowell&rsquo;s army was composed
of the best soldiers in the Northern
States, and they had splendid fire-arms,
artillery, uniforms, and tents&mdash;in fact, all
that money could buy to make them do good
service in the field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>On the other hand, the Confederates were
poorly clad and had old muskets and cannon;
many of the cavalry had only the shot-guns
which they had used for hunting in their boyhood
days.</p>
<p>The North fully expected that this fine
army would crush the Confederates at one
blow, and, when General McDowell was a
little slow in marching forward to battle,
began to cry, &ldquo;On to Richmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Large crowds of idlers, editors, reporters,
members of Congress, government officials,
and even ladies went from Washington to
the rear of the Federal army in order to witness
the defeat of the Confederates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>General Beauregard now sent word to General
Johnston to leave Patterson and come
across the mountains to his aid. General
Johnston at once sent Colonel Stuart with
his cavalry to face Patterson, and to try to
keep him from finding out that Johnston
had left Winchester and had gone to the help
of Beauregard.</p>
<p>This order Stuart obeyed so well that
Johnston was at Manassas, sixty miles away,
before Patterson discovered the ruse.</p>
<p>General Johnston&rsquo;s army set out from Winchester
on the forenoon of Thursday, July
18th. The First Virginia Brigade, led by
General Jackson, headed the line of march.
As they passed through the streets of Winchester,
the people asked, with sad faces, if
they were going to hand them over to the foe.
The soldiers, for reply, said that they knew
not where, or for what purpose, they were
marching southeast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>But when they had marched about three
miles, General Johnston called a halt, and
an order was read to them explaining that
they were going to Beauregard, who was then
on the eve of a great battle with McDowell.
The General hoped that his troops would act
like men and save their country.</p>
<p>At these words, the men rent the air with
their shouts and went forward at a double-quick,
waded the Shenandoah river, which
was waist deep, crossed the Blue Ridge
mountains at Ashby&rsquo;s Gap, and some hours
after night paused to rest for awhile at the
village of Paris, on the eastern slope of the
mountains.</p>
<p>Dr. Dabney tells us that here, while the
men slept, Jackson himself kept watch, saying,
&ldquo;Let the poor fellows sleep; I will
guard the camp myself.&rdquo; For two hours he
paced up and down under the trees, or sat
on the fence. At last, an hour before daybreak,
he gave up his watch to a member of
his staff, and rolling himself upon the grass
in a fence-corner, was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Let the poor fellows sleep; I will guard the camp myself.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>At peep of day, the brigade was up and
away, and, by dusk on July 19th, the whole
command, dusty, hungry, and foot-sore,
marched into an old pine-field near Manassas,
where they spent Saturday in resting
for the coming battle.</p>
<p>The Confederate lines stretched for eight
miles along the southern bank of Bull Run,
which could be forded at several places. At
these fords General Beauregard had placed
large bodies of men. On July 18th, before
Jackson had come up, General McDowell had
tried to take these fords, but his troops had
been driven back.</p>
<p>He then made a plan to march a part of
his forces around the Confederates&rsquo; left wing
at a certain stone bridge, and to get in their
rear. Being thus between two large forces,
the Confederates would be crushed or forced
to surrender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>On Sunday morning, July 21st, General
McDowell sent forward a portion of his troops
to the stone bridge, which was guarded at
that time by the gallant Colonel Evans, with
only eleven hundred men. After he had
fought desperately for several hours, and just
as he was outflanked and sorely beset, Generals
Bee and Bartow came up to his aid,
and for awhile turned the tide of battle.</p>
<p>At last, however, the Confederates were
slowly forced back by larger numbers. At
this moment, General Jackson reached the
spot with his brigade of two thousand six
hundred men. These he quickly placed on
the crest of a ridge in the edge of a pine
thicket, and before them posted seventeen
cannon.</p>
<p>Generals Bee and Bartow and Colonel
Evans rallied their broken lines on the right;
while on the left were a few regiments of
Virginia and Carolina troops. The whole
force numbered about six thousand five hundred
men. The infantry of his brigade were
ordered by Jackson to lie down behind the
artillery to escape the fire of the enemy, who
were now coming across the valley and up
the hill with twenty thousand men and
twenty-four cannon. Just then, Generals
Johnston and Beauregard galloped to the
front and cheered the men on in every part
of the field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>From eleven o&rsquo;clock A. M. until three
o&rsquo;clock P. M., the artillery shook the earth
with its dreadful roar, and thousands of
musket-balls whizzed through the air, black
with the smoke of battle.</p>
<p>While the artillery fight was going on,
General Jackson rode back and forth between
the guns and his regiments lying prone upon
the ground in the burning sun, and greatly
tried by bursting shell and grape-shot. His
erect form and blazing eyes brought hope
and courage to them in this their first baptism
of fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img" id="pic21">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="599" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>There is Jackson, standing like a Stone Wall!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At last General Bee, seeing his thin ranks
begin to waver, said, &ldquo;General, they are
beating us back.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Jackson,
&ldquo;we will give them the bayonet.&rdquo; Bee,
catching the spirit of Jackson, galloped back
to his men, saying, &ldquo;There is Jackson, standing
like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!&rdquo;
A few score of the men rallied
around the gallant Bee and charged upon
the foe. In a few moments the brave Bee
fell dead, with his face to the foe. &ldquo;From
that time,&rdquo; says Draper, an historian of the
North, &ldquo;the name which Jackson had received
in a baptism of fire, displaced that
which he had received in a baptism of water,
and he was known ever after as &lsquo;Stonewall
Jackson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Both of Jackson&rsquo;s flanks were now in danger,
and he saw that the moment had come
to use the bayonet. Wheeling his cannon to
right and left, he gave the signal to his men
to rise, and cried out to the Second regiment,
&ldquo;Reserve your fire until they come within
fifty yards; and then fire and give them the
bayonet; and when you charge, yell like
furies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His men sprang to their feet, fired one
deadly volley, and then dashed down upon
the foe. The latter could not stand this
dreadful onset, but turned and fled. A
battery which had been captured by the
foe was retaken, and the centre of the enemy&rsquo;s
line of battle pierced by Jackson&rsquo;s men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>For four hours, Jackson had kept the
enemy at bay, but now help was near at
hand. Just as the Federals had rallied and
again advanced in large numbers, General
Kirby Smith, with a body of men which had
just come from the Valley, and Generals Early
and Holmes, with reserve troops, hurried up
and struck the right wing of the Federal
army, while the Confederates in the centre
turned against them their own guns. This
onset proved too much for the Federals. They
again fled; and this time, their retreat became
a general rout. The men in terror
cast away their guns, and leaving cannon
and flags, rushed for the nearest fords of Bull
Run. The Confederate cavalry pursued them,
while Kemper&rsquo;s field battery ploughed them
through and through with shells. The road
to Washington was one surging mass of human
beings struggling to get away from the
dreadful field of death.</p>
<p>General Jackson&rsquo;s troops took no part in
pursuit except to plant a battery and fire at
the fleeing foe, many of whom did not stop
until they were safe across the Long Bridge
at Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>

<p class="caption"><i>Rout of Federal Troops at Manassas.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Though the Confederates were the victors,
they had lost many brave men. Generals
Bee and Bartow were killed, and General
Kirby Smith was badly wounded. General
Jackson had been wounded in his left hand
early in the action, but had taken no notice
of it. Now that the battle was over, he felt
the pain acutely, and went to the field-hospital,
which had been placed by the side of
a brook beneath the shade of some friendly
willow-trees.</p>
<p>When he came up, his friend, Dr. McGuire,
said, &ldquo;General, are you much hurt?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
replied he; &ldquo;I believe it is a trifle.&rdquo; &ldquo;How
goes the day?&rdquo; asked the Doctor. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
exclaimed Jackson, &ldquo;We have beaten them;
we have gained a glorious victory.&rdquo; Dr. Dabney
says that this was the only time that
Jackson was ever heard to express joy at
having gained the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>When the surgeons came around him to
dress his wounded hand he said, &ldquo;No, I can
wait; my wound is but a trifle; attend first
to those poor fellows.&rdquo; He then sat down
upon the grass and waited until the wounds
of the badly hurt had been dressed. At first
it was thought that his middle finger would
have to be cut off, but Dr. McGuire having
dressed it very skilfully, it was saved,
and his hand at length healed.</p>
<p>It is stated by several friends that General
Jackson said, while having his hand dressed,
that, with ten thousand fresh troops, he believed
that he could go into Washington city.
However, as he was not the commanding
general, he could not make the attempt, but
could only do as he was ordered.</p>
<p>I must not fail to give you a part of a letter
which he wrote to his wife the day after
the battle, July 22nd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday we fought a great battle and gained
a great victory, for which all the glory is due <i>to
God alone</i>. Though under fire for several hours,
I received only one wound, the breaking of the
longest finger of the left hand, but the doctor says
that it can be saved. My horse was wounded, but
not killed. My coat got an ugly wound near the
hip. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* While great credit is due to other
parts of our gallant army, God made my brigade
more instrumental than any other in repulsing the
main attack.</p>
<p>This is for you alone. Say nothing about it.
Let another speak praise, not myself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>But the praise of the Stonewall Brigade
was not sung by Jackson alone. Both friend
and foe unite in saying that if Jackson had
not held the hill, which was the key to the
Confederate position, until help came, the
battle of Manassas (Bull Run) would have
been a defeat, and not a victory for the South.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s eagle eye saw the place to make
a stand, and he held it for four hours against
all odds.</p>
<p>At one time, while his men were lying
upon the ground, they were so harassed by
the bursting of shells that some of the officers
begged to be permitted to advance.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;wait for the signal;
<i>this place must be held</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>We do not seek to take glory from other
heroes of this wonderful battle, many of
whom, as Bee and Bartow, bravely gave up
their lives in the storm of battle; or, as
Smith and Early, made forced marches in
order to rescue those so sorely pressed; but
we do say that, in one sense, Jackson was
the hero of the first battle of Manassas.</p>
<p>In this battle the Confederates captured
twenty-eight cannon with five thousand
muskets and vast stores of articles useful
to their needy army.</p>
<p>The Confederates lost three hundred and
sixty-nine killed on the field, and fourteen
hundred and eighty-three wounded.</p>
<p>The road to Washington was now open,
and there is no doubt that General Jackson
thought it best to press on while the enemy
was routed and take possession of the city.</p>
<p>But the commanding generals were afraid
to risk the attempt with an army which had
been drilled only a few weeks and which had
so little discipline; and, thus, the moment to
strike passed by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>In a few days the North had chosen a
new commander, General McClellan, who set
himself to raise new armies to defend Washington
and to scourge the South.</p>
<p>Soon after the battle, General Jackson
moved his men to a piece of woodland near
by, where he employed the time in drilling
his troops. After a time the Confederate
lines were pushed forward to within sight of
Washington city, but no battle took place,
as General McClellan was too wise to risk
another engagement so soon after Manassas.</p>
<p>In October, General Jackson was promoted
to the rank of Major-General, and was sent
to the Shenandoah Valley to take command
of the army which had been fighting in West
Virginia.</p>
<p>The Stonewall Brigade was left behind
with General Johnston. This was a great
trial, both to General Jackson and to the
brigade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>When the time came for him to leave for
the new field of war, he ordered the brigade
to march out under arms, and then rode to
their front with his staff. Dr. Dabney says
that no cheer arose, but every face was sad.</p>
<p>After speaking a few words of praise and
love, he threw his bridle reins on the neck
of his horse, and stretching his arms towards
them said: &ldquo;In the Army of the Shenandoah,
you were the First Brigade. In the Army of
the Potomac, you were the First Brigade. In
the Second Corps of the army, you are the
First Brigade. You are the First Brigade in
the affections of your General; and I hope,
by your future deeds and bearing, you will
be handed down to posterity as the First
Brigade in this, our second War of Independence.
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then waved his hand, and left the
grounds at a gallop, followed by the cheers
of his brave soldiers. This separation, however,
was for but a short time. In November
following, the First Brigade was ordered
to join Jackson at Winchester, and it remained
with him until the fatal hour at
Chancellorsville, when it lost him forever.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Major-General.</span></h2>
<p>When the year 1862 opened, General Jackson
was at Winchester with ten thousand
men, Generals Loring and Henry Jackson
having come from Western Virginia to join
his command.</p>
<p>At the head of Jackson&rsquo;s cavalry was
Lieutenant-Colonel Ashby, a gallant, brave,
and watchful officer. At
the sound of his well-known
shout and the cry
of &ldquo;Ashby,&rdquo; from his
men, the Federal soldiers
would turn and flee as if
from a host. Ever guarding
the outposts of the
army, he was Jackson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;eyes and ears.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic24">
<img src="images/p24a.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="599" />
<p class="caption"><i>Lieut.-Col. Ashby.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>There were now three great armies threatening
Jackson, and he well knew that they
would crush him if he did not meet each one
singly before they could unite.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s little army was the guard to
Johnston&rsquo;s flank. The latter general, with
forty thousand men, was still at Manassas
facing McClellan, who was at the head of an
army of fifty thousand men, and preparing,
as soon as spring opened, to &ldquo;walk over
Johnston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson knew that if his army was defeated,
Johnston would have to retreat, and
perhaps the whole State would be given up
to the foe. The armies were now in winter
quarters, and there was not much danger of
a move before spring.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jackson resolved to
march against several large forces of Federals
which were threatening him from the towns
of Romney and Bath, forty miles distant,
in Northwestern Virginia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It was the last of December, however,
before he could collect the men and supplies
necessary for the expedition.</p>
<p>At last, on the first day of January, 1862,
all was ready. The little army of about nine
thousand men set out without knowing
whither Jackson was leading, for he had not
told even his officers his great plans.</p>
<p>In spite of the winter season, the day was
bright and the air soft and balmy. So warm
was the weather that the men left their overcoats
and blankets to be brought on in the
wagons. On the next day, a biting wind
began to blow, which was followed by rain
and snow.</p>
<p>The men marched all day, and at night
the wagons, which had not been able to keep
up with the troops, were still far behind.
The troops rested that night without rations
or blankets, having only camp-fires to keep
off the cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>On the third day, the men were so overcome
by cold and hunger that they found it
difficult to go forward. Jackson, riding
grimly along the way, found his old brigade
halted, and asked General Garnett the reason
of the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have halted,&rdquo; said General Garnett,
&ldquo;to let the men cook rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not time for it,&rdquo; replied General
Jackson curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is impossible for the men to go
farther without them,&rdquo; said Garnett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never found anything impossible with
that brigade,&rdquo; said Jackson as he rode on.
He was restive and eager to press forward;
his plan to surprise the enemy did not admit
of delay.</p>
<p>As the army neared the town of Bath, a
force of Federals suddenly attacked it from
behind trees and fences, but it was soon
driven off with the loss of twenty prisoners.</p>
<p>That night the Southern troops went into
camp just outside the town, in the midst of
a heavy snow storm. The men were without
food or blankets, and the wonder is how
they lived through the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Jackson, however, did not change his plans,
though there was great complaint among the
men, many of whom straggled back to Winchester.</p>
<p>The next morning, after a hearty breakfast,
the order was given to advance upon
Bath. The artillery opened fire and the
infantry charged the breastworks, but the
Federals hastily gave up the town, and fled
towards the Potomac river, which they waded
that night.</p>
<p>The Southern troops on entering the town
found quantities of stores which the Federals
had left behind; among them were fine
clothes, china, and even dinners, cooked and
still smoking, ready to be eaten by the hungry
Confederates.</p>
<p>From Bath, Jackson&rsquo;s men passed, with
great difficulty and suffering, to a place called
Hancock, about three miles distant from
Bath, on the north side of the Potomac.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Jackson placed his cannon on the south
bank and opened a hot fire on the town, but
the commander refused to surrender. As a
large force of men came up to reinforce the
Federals, Jackson concluded to pass on to
Romney.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the railroad bridge over
Capon river had been destroyed and the
telegraph wires cut by General Loring, so
that the commander at Romney could not
send to General Banks for help.</p>
<p>The weather had now become terrible.
Rain, snow, sleet, and hail beat down upon
men still without tents, overcoats, and blankets;
for it was impossible for the wagons to
come up. The mountain roads were covered
with ice and sleet so that horses and men
could not keep their footing. Many fell flat,
badly hurt, while wagon after wagon slid
down the steep banks, and was overturned
and broken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Jackson was everywhere along the line
cheering the troops and even helping them
along. We are told by Cooke, our great
Virginia writer, that, as Jackson was passing
a point in the road where a piece of
artillery had stalled, while a crowd of men
were looking on without helping, he stopped,
dismounted, and, without uttering a word,
put his shoulder to the wheel. The men,
shamed, came forward to take their places,
the horses were whipped up, and the piece
moved on.</p>
<p>After great hardships, the little army at
last reached Romney, on the 14th of January,
to find that the Federals had retreated, leaving
behind them large military stores, which
fell into the hands of the Confederates.</p>
<p>Even then, the name of Jackson was a
terror to the foe. With a force much larger
than Jackson&rsquo;s, and when he was more than
a day&rsquo;s march distant, the Federals had fled
and left the greater part of their baggage.</p>
<p>In sixteen days, he had driven the enemy
out of his district, had rendered the railroad
useless to the Federals for more than a hundred
miles, and had captured arms enough
to equip an army as large as his own. This
he had done with the loss of four men killed
and twenty-eight wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Leaving General Loring at Romney with
a portion of the army, Jackson hastened
back to Winchester to watch the movements
of General Banks, who was stationed, with a
large army, near Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>
<p>Upon his return, he found the whole country
in an uproar over the expedition to Romney
through the sleet and snow. Though
no one could say that Jackson was not full of
courage and devotion to the South, many
said that he was cruel and not fit to be in
command of an army. Some said that he
was a madman; others, that he was without
common sense. Another charge against him
was that he was partial to the Stonewall
Brigade, as he had brought it back with him
to the comforts of a town, while he had left
Loring&rsquo;s command in the mountains. The
soldiers of the brigade were called &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s
Pet Lambs,&rdquo; and other like names.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Now, the truth was, that Loring&rsquo;s men
were far more comfortable than those of the
Stonewall Brigade; the former being ordered
into huts, while the latter were in tents,
three miles from Winchester.</p>
<p>Another charge against him was that he
would tell his plans to no one. &ldquo;It was his
maxim,&rdquo; says Dabney, &ldquo;that in war, mystery
was the key to success.&rdquo; He argued that
no man could tell what bit of news might
not be of use to the foe, and therefore, that
it was the part of wisdom to conceal everything.</p>
<p>This secrecy irritated his officers, and it
must be said that some of them so far forgot
their duty as soldiers as to treat General
Jackson with disrespect.</p>
<p>Though all of these charges were known
to Jackson, he took no notice of them, but
was proceeding to connect Romney with
Winchester by telegraph wires when, on January
31st, he received this order from Richmond:
&ldquo;Order Loring back to Winchester
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The cause of this order was that some of
the officers at Romney had sent a petition to
Richmond asking to be sent back to Winchester,
as the position at Romney was, in
their opinion, too much exposed.</p>
<p>General Jackson recalled the troops from
Romney, but he was so angry at the way in
which he had been treated by the government,
that he at once resigned his command.</p>
<p>This caused great excitement in the army
and in the State at large. The people were
by no means willing to give up an officer
who had shown so much courage and skill,
and they begged him to withdraw his resignation.
This he refused to do. He said
that the government had shown, by the order,
that it did not trust him, and that, if he was
to be meddled with in that way, he could do
no good. At last, however, a sort of an
apology being made by the government, he
quietly took up his duties again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>In a few days after General Loring left
Romney, the Federals again took possession
of that town and the country around. So
all the efforts of Jackson and the trials of
his soldiers were of no avail. This was a
great blow to General Jackson, for Winchester
was again exposed to the advance of
the foe from four directions.</p>
<p>The plan for the invasion of Virginia in
1862 was the same as in 1861. General
Fremont was marching from the Northwest;
Banks, from Harper&rsquo;s Ferry; McDowell, from
Fredericksburg; McClellan faced Johnston at
Manassas, and another large army was at
Fortress Monroe, ready to march up the
Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Northern army was much larger than
the year before, but the Southern army was
smaller, as the time of many of the men had
expired and others had gone home on
furlough.</p>
<p>Several brigades were now taken from
General Jackson to strengthen other points,
and he found himself left, with only six
thousand men, to guard the left of Johnston&rsquo;s
army and to protect the great Shenandoah
Valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>On the 26th of February, General Banks,
with thirty-five thousand men, and General
Kelly, with eleven thousand, advanced
against Jackson, who was still at Winchester,
hoping to hold that place, until
help could come from General Johnston.
But finding out through Colonel Ashby that
he was almost surrounded by the enemy, he
left Winchester and fell back slowly to Mt.
Jackson, a village on the great turnpike,
forty miles from Winchester. Here, he had
sent all of his stores and sick soldiers some
weeks before; so that, when the Federals
entered Winchester, they found not a
prisoner or a musket to &ldquo;enrich their
conquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great trial to Jackson to leave
his kind friends in Winchester, but he
promised them &ldquo;to wait for a better time
and come again.&rdquo; We shall see how well
he kept his promise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>On March 19th, General Johnston wrote
to General Jackson at Mt. Jackson, asking
him to move closer to the enemy and to prevent
him, if possible, from sending troops
across to McClellan. Word was brought at
the same time, that fifteen thousand men
were then leaving the army of Banks to aid
in turning the left wing of Johnston&rsquo;s forces,
as he fell back to lines of defense nearer
Richmond.</p>
<p>So Jackson gave orders to his little army,
which now numbered only twenty-seven
hundred men, to march back down the Valley.
That night the infantry slept at Strasburg,
while Ashby&rsquo;s men drove in the outposts
of the Federals at Winchester.</p>
<p>General Banks, thinking that Jackson
would trouble him no more, had left for
Washington, and General Shields was in
command of the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>General Jackson, on the morning of March
23rd, pushed forward his whole force, and,
when about five miles from Winchester, at a
place called Kernstown, he found Ashby
fighting furiously with the advance of the
foe. Taking a good position, he at once
gave battle, though he saw that he was
greatly outnumbered. The battle raged from
about noon until night. Regiment after
regiment was hurled against Jackson&rsquo;s thin
ranks, but they fought stubbornly and would
have gained the day, had not the ammunition
of the Stonewall Brigade given out.
Hearing his fire dying away for want of
ammunition, General Garnett gave orders
for his men to retreat. When Jackson saw
the lines of his old brigade give back, he
galloped to the spot, and, ordering Garnett
to hold his ground, pushed forward to rally
the men. Seeing a drummer boy retreating
like the rest, he seized him by the shoulder,
dragged him in full view of the soldiers, and
said in his sternest tones, &ldquo;Beat the rally!&rdquo;
The drummer beat the rally, and in the midst
of a storm of balls Jackson saw the lines
reform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<div class="img" id="pic25">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" alt="" width="503" height="800" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Beat the Rally!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But it was too late. The enemy now
pressed forward in such numbers that there
was nothing left to do but to retreat. This
they did in good order, but the Federals
held the field of battle where so many dead
and wounded men were lying.</p>
<p>In this battle of Kernstown twenty-seven
hundred Confederates, with eleven guns attacked
eleven thousand Federals and almost
gained the victory. It is said that General
Shields had just given orders for his men to
retreat when the Stonewall Brigade fell back.</p>
<p>As General Shields followed Jackson up
the Valley after the battle, he stopped at a
noted country house for the night. General
Jackson had also rested there upon his retreat,
and from his adjutant the lady of the
house had learned the correct number of
Jackson&rsquo;s men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>General Shields, at breakfast, entered into
a conversation with his hostess, and in a
polite way boasted of his great victory.
&ldquo;Ah! General,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;we can
afford such defeats as that, when twenty-seven
hundred men hold back eleven thousand
for hours and then retreat at leisure!
Such defeats are victories.&rdquo; General Shields
was surprised to learn the small number of
Jackson&rsquo;s forces, and begged the lady to tell
him her informant. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the
lady, &ldquo;General Jackson&rsquo;s adjutant, Major
Paxton. I have also information that large
reinforcements are coming
to Jackson and that
he will again be ready
to meet you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have
no doubt of that, my
dear Madam,&rdquo; smilingly
returned the
General.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic26">

<p class="caption"><i>Major E. F. Paxton.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>That night Jackson&rsquo;s
little army rested near
Newtown, while Ashby kept watch not far
from the field of battle. &ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; says
Cooke, &ldquo;got an armful of corn for his horse;
and, wrapping his blanket about him, lay
down by a fire in a fence corner and went
to sleep.&rdquo; Though defeated for the first and
last time, he had won the object of the battle.
The fifteen thousand men who had
started across the mountains to McClellan
were recalled to the Valley, and Johnston
was able to move safely behind the Rappahannock
river, his new line of defense.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the
24th, Jackson began to retreat slowly and
in good order. The enemy pursued for
awhile, but at last fell back to Winchester.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s army was far from cast down
by the defeat at Kernstown. The soldiers
felt that they had made a splendid fight
against four times their number. And now,
too, for the first time, it began to dawn upon
them that their general was a great leader.
As Jackson passed along the columns, the
men would cheer themselves hoarse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Cooke tells us that one man was heard to
ask, as he struggled along, &ldquo;Why is Old Jack
a better general than Moses?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because
it took Moses forty years to lead the Israelites
through the wilderness, and Old Jack
would have double-quicked them through it
in three days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said by another writer, that the men
would laugh and say that the only rest they
had was when they were retreating before
the enemy. He always led them by forced
marches when going to attack the foe, but
never fast enough on a retreat to lose the
chances of a fight.</p>
<p>The weather was now mild and balmy,
and the men suffered few hardships during
their slow retreat. At last they reached the
old camp at Mt. Jackson, where Jackson
gathered up his wounded and sent them up
the Valley.</p>
<p>On the 1st of April, he crossed the north
fork of the Shenandoah, and took position on
Rude&rsquo;s Hill, five miles below New Market.</p>
<p>General Banks had again come up the
Valley, and was pressing upon the rear of
Jackson&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>It was left for Colonel Ashby to burn the
bridge near Mt. Jackson, after the Southern
army had passed over. While Ashby and
his men were engaged in this work, the
Federal cavalry dashed up and a skirmish
ensued, in which Ashby&rsquo;s beautiful snow-white
charger was mortally wounded.</p>
<p>General Jackson remained at Rude&rsquo;s Hill
until April 17th, when, the waters having
subsided so that the Federal army could
cross the river, he again took up his line of
march through New Market to Harrisonburg.
At the last named place he turned east, and,
passing the south end of Massanutton mountain,
crossed the south branch of the Shenandoah
river and posted his troops in the gorge
of the Blue Ridge called Swift Run Gap.</p>
<p>The way to Staunton was now open to
General Banks, but he was too timid to go
forward. Jackson in his rear was worse than
Jackson in front of him. So, for two weeks,
Jackson held the Gap while Banks occupied
Harrisonburg, and laid waste the country
around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Jackson had now about eight thousand
men and thirty guns. His men had returned
from hospitals and furloughs and also
a number of new recruits had poured in to
help in this time of danger. The General
employed these weeks of rest in organizing
and drilling his men and in mending up his
old artillery. In the meantime also, he made
bold plans, and with the help of General R.
E. Lee, who had now been made commander
of the &ldquo;Army of Northern Virginia,&rdquo; proceeded
to carry them out.</p>
<p>Now, in order to understand the great
genius of our hero, and the bravery and endurance
of his men, you must study the map
on the next page.</p>
<p>You will see that the Valley of the Shenandoah
is bounded on the east by the Blue
Ridge mountains, and on the west by the
Alleghany. Winchester is situated in the
northern part of the Valley, while Staunton
is about ninety miles to the south. These
two places are connected by a fine turnpike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<div class="img" id="pic27">
<img src="images/p27.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="529" />
<p class="caption">THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Now, near the center of the Valley, rises
a beautiful mountain which the Indians
called Massanutton, and which still retains
that name. This mountain begins near
Strasburg and extends about fifty miles
towards Staunton, ending abruptly not far
from Harrisonburg.</p>
<p>There is only one gap in the Massanutton
mountain, and that is opposite the towns of
New Market and Luray.</p>
<p>The valley east of the mountain is called
the Page Valley, while the entire valley, including
the Page Valley, is the Shenandoah
Valley.</p>
<p>Some of the children who will read this
book live under the shadow and in sight of
this lovely mountain, which enabled Jackson
to play at &ldquo;hide and seek&rdquo; with his foe, and
I hope they will understand thoroughly the
great movements which I shall relate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Though Jackson and his little army were
safe in Swift Run Gap, opposite the village
of Elkton, for awhile, they could not have
remained there long, as three major-generals,
with as many large armies, were marching
to surround and crush them. Banks was
only fifteen miles distant, Milroy was coming
by way of Staunton from Western Virginia,
and Fremont from the northwest.
General McDowell, at Fredericksburg, was
also ordered to send twenty thousand men to
the Valley, instead of advancing to help
McClellan, who was now near Richmond
with a large army. You see, Jackson was
bravely obeying General Johnston&rsquo;s orders
to keep the Federals busy in the Valley and
to prevent them from reinforcing McClellan.</p>
<p>Now, there was a small force of Confederates,
under General Edward Johnson, on
Shenandoah mountain, twenty miles west of
Staunton. There was great danger that
Milroy with his larger army would overcome
Johnson, take Staunton, and march on to
join Banks. Their two armies would then
be large enough to crush Jackson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<div class="img" id="pic28">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="801" />
<p class="caption"><i>Generals Jackson, Johnston, and Lee.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>It was also important to keep Staunton
out of the hands of the foe, as it was situated
on the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, which
carried supplies from the fertile Valley to
Richmond.</p>
<p>So General Jackson wrote to General Lee
that he would go to the help of Johnson and
protect Staunton, if he (Lee) would send a
force to hold Banks in check during his
absence.</p>
<p>This General Lee did, sending from Richmond
General Ewell (&#363;&prime;-el), a brave officer,
with eight thousand men, who marched into
Swift Run Gap from the east and took the
places which Jackson&rsquo;s men had just left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>It was now Jackson&rsquo;s object to reach
Staunton without the knowledge of Banks,
so he marched, with great difficulty, through
miry roads, down the mountain about eight
miles to another gap across the Blue Ridge,
called Brown&rsquo;s Gap. When there, he turned
east and marched swiftly across the mountain
into Albemarle county, passing through
the village of White Hall to Mechum&rsquo;s River
Station. Thence the troops were carried
swiftly by rail to Staunton, reaching there
on the night of the 4th of May, to the great
joy of the people of Staunton, who thought
that they had been deserted by Jackson in
their time of need.</p>
<p>By Monday the whole army had come up.
They were then joined by General Johnson
and his army. On the 7th, one day having
been spent in preparing for the march, Jackson,
with General Johnson&rsquo;s command in
front, marched towards Milroy, who was now
posted on Shenandoah mountain.</p>
<p>Jackson had been joined at Staunton by
the corps of cadets from the Military Institute
at Lexington under Col. Scott Shipp.
Many of them were mere boys, but they were
filled with joy at taking their first look at
grim war under Stonewall Jackson, who had
so lately been a professor in that school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>As the Confederate army approached Shenandoah
mountain, the Federals retreated to
the village of McDowell.</p>
<p>On Thursday, May 8th, Jackson and
Johnson, with the command of the latter
still in advance, climbed the sides of the
mountain overlooking that little village.</p>
<p>That evening, while the generals were
waiting for the rest of the army to come up,
General Milroy made an attack upon their
position.</p>
<p>Though not expecting an attack, Jackson
quickly placed his troops for the conflict,
the center of the line being held by the
Twelfth Georgia regiment with great bravery.
It is related that, when ordered at one time
to retire behind the crest of the hill to
escape the raking fire of the foe, they refused
to do so, and kept their position. The next
day a tall youth from the Georgia regiment
was asked why they did not fall back as
ordered. He replied, &ldquo;We did not come all
the way to Virginia to run before Yankees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<div class="img" id="pic29">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="800" />
<p class="caption"><i>The Twelfth Georgia Regiment at McDowell.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Just before the close of the battle, General
Johnson was wounded in the ankle and
compelled to leave the field.</p>
<p>The battle of McDowell raged from half-past
four to half-past eight P. M., the shades
of night closing the conflict. Then the Federals
gave up the assault and retreated
from the field. &ldquo;By nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; says Dr.
Dabney, &ldquo;the roar of the struggle had passed
away, and the green battle-field reposed
under the starlight as calmly as when it
had been occupied only by its peaceful
herds of cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock A. M. before General
Jackson reached his tent, having waited to
see the last wounded man brought off the
battle-field, and the last picket posted. He
had eaten nothing since morning, but when
his faithful servant, Jim, came with food, he
said, &ldquo;I want none&mdash;nothing but sleep&rdquo;;
and in a moment he was fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>He was in the saddle at peep of day; but,
upon climbing the mountain, he saw that
the enemy had left during the night. He at
once sent this dispatch to Richmond: &ldquo;God
blessed our arms with victory at McDowell
yesterday,&rdquo; and then set out in pursuit of
the fleeing Federals. He had followed them
as far as Franklin, when the woods were set
on fire by the Federals to conceal their position.</p>
<p>The dense smoke hung like a pall over the
mountain roads, and the heat from the blazing
forests was terrible. But still, the long
column pressed on until Monday, when General
Jackson received an order from General
Lee to return to the Valley and pay his
respects to General Banks, who was now at
Strasburg.</p>
<p>When the latter general had found out
that Ewell was holding the Swift Run Gap,
and that Jackson had left to go&mdash;no one
knew whither&mdash;he left Harrisonburg and
retreated to Strasburg. Jackson was lost,
and, not knowing where he might next
appear, General Banks thought it more prudent
to take a safer position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Time was now precious to Jackson; so,
after halting for a brief rest, during which
time the whole army met to render thanks
to God for the great victory, he set out on
his return march to the Valley.</p>
<p>On the 20th, he was again in New Market,
where he was joined by General Ewell.</p>
<p>By a bold plan and a swift march he
had saved the army of General Johnson,
and prevented Milroy from taking Staunton
and joining Banks, and now he was again
in pursuit of the latter.</p>
<p>General Banks was fortifying at Strasburg,
and seemed to expect an attack in
front, so Jackson wisely planned to attack
him in the rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>You remember that I told you that just
east of New Market there is a pass, or gap,
through the Massanutton mountain. Now
Jackson sent a small force of cavalry down
the turnpike towards Strasburg to hold it,
and conceal the movements of the main
army, which he himself led eastward across
the mountain into the Page Valley.</p>
<p>Hidden by the friendly mountain, his
troops marched quickly and silently to the
town of Front Royal, which is at the northern
end of the mountain, and which then guarded
the flank of Banks&rsquo; army.</p>
<p>So swift and silent had been the march,
that Jackson&rsquo;s men were nearly in sight of
the town before anyone knew of their
presence.</p>
<p>One mile and a half from the town, the
pickets were driven in, and an instant advance
was ordered. The Confederate troops
rushed to the attack. The Federals, thinking
that Jackson was at least one hundred
miles away, in the mountains of Western
Virginia, were taken completely by surprise.
They surrendered by hundreds, giving up
quantities of valuable stores, among which
were five hundred new revolvers and a
wagon load of coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>The people of Front Royal were wild
with joy at seeing the Confederates again,
but the troops were not permitted to stop.
On through the town they went at a double-quick,
for the Federals had now made a
stand outside of the town. But they were
speedily put to flight, and the pursuit went on.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Confederate cavalry
came upon a body of Federals near Cedarville,
five miles from Front Royal. A charge
was at once made upon the Federals by the
Confederates, and the whole force was driven
back. The Federals then reformed in an
orchard, and were again charged upon by the
Confederates, and, after a fierce contest, were
captured.</p>
<p>As night came on, the weary Southern
troops went into camp, for they were quite
worn out with marching and fighting.</p>
<p>The next morning, May 24th, the troops
were again moving by peep of day. Our
hero himself rode forward towards Middletown.
When in sight of the turnpike
which leads from Strasburg to Winchester,
he saw long lines of Federal horsemen in full
retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<div class="img" id="pic30">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="504" />
<p class="caption"><i>Confederate Cavalry charge at Cedarville.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>The batteries of Poague and Chew were
brought forward and a hot fire opened upon
the retreating foe. The latter broke in wild
confusion, and soon the turnpike was filled
with a mass of struggling and dying horses
and men. A few regiments which formed
the rear guard fell back to Strasburg, and,
leaving their baggage at that place, fled
through the western mountains to the Potomac
river.</p>
<p>On the turnpike, Ashby with his cavalry
followed closely after the fleeing foe, firing
upon them with shot and shell.</p>
<p>Cooke says: &ldquo;Either a shell or a round
shot would strike one of the wagons and
overturn it, and before those behind could
stop their headway, they would thunder
down on the remains of the first. Others
would tumble in so as to block up the road;
and in the midst of it all, Ashby&rsquo;s troopers
would swoop down, taking prisoners or
cutting down such as resisted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Ashby himself pressed forward, and at
one time, it is said, took as many as thirty
prisoners, unaided and alone.</p>
<p>But Ashby&rsquo;s men soon betook themselves
to plundering the wagons, which were rich
in stores, and thus gave the enemy time to
recover from their panic. When near Newtown,
the enemy turned and fired upon their
pursuers.</p>
<p>At dark, however, the firing ceased, and
Jackson himself went forward to urge on
the pursuit.</p>
<p>The main body of the army had now
come up, but no halt was made for food or
rest. The &ldquo;foot cavalry&rdquo; of the Valley
marched all night along the pike lit up by
&ldquo;burning wagons, pontoon bridges, and
stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every now and then, they would come
upon men ambuscaded along the sides of
the pike, and fierce fights would ensue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>About dawn on the 25th of May, Jackson&rsquo;s
advance force climbed the lofty hill
southwest of Winchester. This hill was
already held by the Federals, but they were
charged upon by the Stonewall Brigade, and
driven back. With a loud shout the Confederates
gained the crest of the hill and
planted their batteries. Though they had
marched all night, they took no rest or food,
but at once began the battle of Winchester.</p>
<p>Ewell fought on the right and Taylor on
the left. &ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; says a writer, &ldquo;had
his war-look on, and rode about the field,
regardless of shot and shell, looking as calm
as if nothing were going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, after a fierce fight, the Federals
gave way, and Jackson entered Winchester
at the heels of the panic-stricken army. The
people of the town were beside themselves
with delight to see their loved general once
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Jackson was for the first time excited.
He waved his faded cap around his head
and cheered with a right good will.</p>
<p>But the troops still pressed forward, Jackson
leading the way. When one of his officers
said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you are going
into too much danger, General?&rdquo; his reply
was, &ldquo;Tell the troops to press right on to
the Potomac.&rdquo; And they did press onward
until the enemy was forced across the Potomac
with the loss of many prisoners and
valuable stores.</p>
<p>After resting a few days, Jackson advanced
towards Harper&rsquo;s Ferry with the view of
attacking the Federal force there, but was
stopped by the news that two armies, one
under General Shields, from the east; the
other under General Fremont, from the west,
were to meet at Strasburg and thus cut him
off from Richmond and capture him.</p>
<p>He at once hastened back to Winchester,
where he collected his prisoners and the
stores of ammunition and medicine which
he had captured. These he sent up the
Valley, and followed rapidly with his whole
army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>In the meantime, there was great terror
at Washington and in the North. Men
wore anxious faces, and were asking each
other, &ldquo;Where is Jackson?&rdquo; They were
afraid that he would turn and capture
Washington.</p>
<p>But Jackson had only about fifteen thousand
men, and he could not risk the loss of
the rich stores which he had gained and the
destruction of his noble army, so he put
forth all his skill and nerve to save them.</p>
<p>The Confederates now began a race to
reach Strasburg before the Federals, the
larger part of the army marching from near
Harper&rsquo;s Ferry to Strasburg, nearly fifty
miles, in about twenty-four hours. Well
might they be called the &ldquo;foot cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>As Jackson marched into Strasburg, General
Fremont&rsquo;s advance was almost in sight;
and, as the Stonewall Brigade had not yet
come up, Jackson sent General Ewell to
hold Fremont in check. A fierce battle
ensued, but Ewell at last drove back the
enemy, and the Stonewall Brigade coming
up that evening, the whole army continued
to retreat up the Valley.</p>
<p>The race had been won by Jackson, who
was, for the present, safe. In a brief space
of time, he had flanked the enemy at Front
Royal, chased them to Middletown, beaten
them at Winchester, and sent them flying
across the Potomac. When nearly entrapped
by two other columns, he had passed between
them, and was now hurrying with his
rich stores to the upper Valley. Cooke tells
us that he had captured two thousand three
hundred prisoners, one hundred cattle, thirty-four
thousand pounds of bacon, salt, sugar,
coffee, hard bread, and cheese, valuable medical
stores, $125,185 worth of other stores,
two pieces of artillery, and many small-arms
and horses. All this was gained with the
loss of about four hundred men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>But, as Jackson retreated up the Valley,
he was again threatened by a great danger.
Shields&rsquo;s column marched up the Page Valley
with the view of crossing the Massanutton
at New Market and striking Jackson in the
rear, just as Jackson had done to Banks
when he went down to Front Royal. But
Jackson was too wary to be taken by surprise.</p>
<p>He sent swift horsemen across the mountain,
who burned the bridges over the south
branch of the Shenandoah at Columbia Mills
and the White House, and then placed signal
stations on top of the mountain to inform
him of what was going on in the Page Valley.</p>
<p>Fremont was now pressing on his rear,
but he moved swiftly up the Valley with
the main army, while Ashby kept guard on
every side. When Harrisonburg was reached,
he again marched east and took his stand
near the village of Port Republic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>On the 6th of June, as the gallant Ashby
was leading a charge to repel the advance of
the Federal forces, he fell, pierced to the
heart by a single bullet. His last words
were, &ldquo;Charge, Virginians!&rdquo; Thus, in the
moment of victory, died the brave and noble
Ashby. His loss was deeply felt by Jackson,
who now needed more than ever, the
daring and skill of his &ldquo;Chief of Cavalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have told you, Jackson was at Port
Republic, a village at the forks of the Shenandoah
river. Fremont was at Harrisonburg,
fifteen miles to the northwest, and
Shields was at Conrad&rsquo;s Store, fifteen miles
to the northeast. The space between the
three generals formed the sides of a triangle.
Just back of Jackson, in the Blue Ridge, was
Brown&rsquo;s Gap, through which he could retreat
and join Lee before Richmond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>But Jackson had no idea of leaving the
Valley without a parting blow. The Shenandoah
was very high, so that Shields and
Fremont could not unite their forces. Jackson
therefore determined to attack Shields
first, and, if victorious, then to turn his
attention to Fremont. I have forgotten to
tell you that Shields was east of the river,
and Fremont to the west; while Jackson
was between the north and south branches
of the Shenandoah, which unite at Port
Republic. There was a bridge over the
north branch, between Jackson and Fremont;
but over the south branch, between
Jackson and Shields, there was only a ford.
The north bank was high, while the south
was low, and stretched away in broad meadows
towards the mountains.</p>
<p>Jackson, leaving the trusty Ewell at Cross
Keys to watch Fremont,
who was advancing
from Harrisonburg,
took possession
of the heights overlooking
the bridge at
Port Republic, and stationed
there two brigades
and his remaining
artillery. A small
body of cavalry was sent across South river
to find out the position of Shields.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic31">
<img src="images/p31.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="601" />
<p class="caption"><i>General R. S. Ewell.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Early on the morning of the 8th of June,
the cavalry came galloping back with the
news that Shields&rsquo;s army was close at hand.
Jackson, who was in the town with some of
his staff, at once gave orders for the batteries
on the north side to open fire; but before it
could be done, the Federal cavalry dashed
into the town followed by artillery, which
rumbled forward and took position at the
southern end of the bridge.</p>
<p>Jackson and his staff were now cut off
from his army, which was on the north
bank. We are told by Cooke and others
that Jackson, with great presence of mind,
rode towards the bridge; and, rising in his
stirrups, called sternly to the Federal officer
commanding the gun, &ldquo;Who told you to
post that gun there, sir? Bring it over
here!&rdquo; The officer, thinking that Jackson
was a Federal general, bowed, &ldquo;limbered
up&rdquo; the piece, and was preparing to move.
In the meantime Jackson and his staff galloped
across the bridge, and were soon safe
on the northern side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<div class="img" id="pic32">

<p class="caption"><i>General Jackson at Port Republic Bridge.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>No time was lost by the Confederates.
Their artillery opened fire upon the Federals,
and Jackson in person led the Thirty-seventh
Virginia regiment, drove the foe from the
bridge, and captured the gun with the loss
of only two men wounded.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jackson&rsquo;s long wagon-train,
which contained his ammunition, was
bravely defended on the outskirts of the
village by a handful of pickets and a section
of artillery until help came.</p>
<p>The fire of the guns on the north bank
made it impossible for the Federals to hold
the village, so, leaving their other gun, they
retreated, and dashed across the ford of the
South river by the way they had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Hardly had the guns stopped firing at
Port Republic, before heavy firing was heard
in the direction of Cross Keys, five miles off,
between Ewell and Fremont. The latter had
twenty thousand men, while Ewell had only
about six thousand. The Confederates were
posted with great skill upon a ridge, and
after fighting from ten A. M. until nightfall,
at last drove back the enemy with great
loss.</p>
<p>The battle of Cross Keys having been
fought, the Confederate troops lay upon their
arms, ready to renew the fray the next day;
but Jackson had other plans.</p>
<p>He had determined to strike Shields next;
so, leaving a guard to watch Fremont, he
ordered Ewell to march at break of day to
Port Republic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>At midnight he caused a foot-bridge to be
thrown across South river so that his infantry
might pass over to attack Shields.
This bridge was made by placing wagons
lengthwise across the swollen stream. The
floor of the bridge was formed of long boards
laid loosely from one wagon to another.
Over this rude, frail structure, the whole
body of infantry passed, but not so quickly
as its general wished. About midway the
stream, for some reason, one wagon was
about two feet higher than the next. This
made a step, and all the boards on the
higher wagon were loose but one. When
the column began to move over, several men
were thrown, by the loose planks, into the
water; so, refusing to trust any but the firm
plank, the men went, at this point, in single
file. This made the crossing over very
tedious; and, instead of being in line to
attack Shields at sunrise, it was ten o&rsquo;clock
before the entire army had passed over.
Thus, three loose boards cost the Confederates
a bloody battle; for they found the
Federals drawn up in battle array and ready
for the fight. This incident shows how much
care should be taken in performing the most
trivial duty; as the success of great events is
often affected by very slight causes. It is
said that Jackson hoped to surprise Shields,
whip him in a few hours, and then recross
the river to rout Fremont.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>But the battle of Port Republic, June 9th,
raged furiously for hours. The Federals
fought with great courage, and it was not
until evening that they gave way and retreated,
panic-stricken, from the field.</p>
<p>The Confederates followed them eight or
ten miles down the river, and returned laden
with spoils and prisoners.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock A. M., Jackson sent orders
for the guard left at Cross Keys under General
Trimble and Colonel Patton to march to
his aid and to burn the bridge behind them.
This they did, and came up in time to join
in the fight.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall General Jackson led
his weary troops by a side road into the safe
recesses of Brown&rsquo;s Gap, in the Blue Ridge.</p>
<p>As they passed the field of battle on their
return, they saw the hills on the north side
of the river crowded with the troops of
Fremont, who had arrived in time to see the
rout of Shields.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The river being high, they did not attempt
to cross, but began a furious cannonade upon
the Confederate surgeons and men who were
caring for the wounded and burying the dead.</p>
<p>The next day, scouts brought word to
Jackson that Fremont was building a bridge,
but soon after, having learned, doubtless,
that General Shields&rsquo;s army was entirely
routed, he retreated.</p>
<p>On June 12th, the Confederate cavalry
under Colonel Munford entered Harrisonburg,
Fremont having gone back down the
Valley, leaving behind him his sick and
wounded, and many valuable stores.</p>
<p>Four hundred and fifty Federals were
taken prisoners on the field, while as many
more were found in the hospitals. One
thousand small-arms and nine field-pieces
fell to the victorious Confederates. The
Federal loss in the two battles was about
two thousand. In the battle of Cross Keys
Jackson lost only forty-two killed and two
hundred and thirty-one wounded; but in
the battle of Port Republic, ninety-one
officers and men were killed, and six hundred
and eighty-six wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Though Jackson&rsquo;s plans had not been
entirely carried out, he was now rid of the
two armies of forty thousand men which
had been on his front and flanks, and had
threatened to crush him.</p>
<p>Within forty days his troops had marched
four hundred miles, fought four great battles,
and defeated four separate armies, sending
to the rear over three thousand prisoners
and vast trains of stores and ammunition.</p>
<p>From this time Jackson stood forth as a
leader of great genius; the little orphan
boy had indeed climbed the heights of fame
amid a &ldquo;blaze of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 12th of June, Jackson led his
army from its camp, in Brown&rsquo;s Gap, to the
plains of Mt. Meridian, a few miles above
Port Republic. Here, the wearied men
rested for five days, while Colonel Munford,
who now commanded the cavalry, kept
watch on the turnpike below Harrisonburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>This is the dispatch which Jackson sent
to Richmond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Near Port Republic</span>, June 9th, 1862.</span></p>
<p>Through God&rsquo;s blessing, the enemy near Port
Republic was this day routed, with the loss of
six pieces of his artillery.</p>
<p><span class="jr">T. J. JACKSON,</span>
<span class="jr"><i>Major-General, commanding.</i>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Saturday following the battle was
set apart by General Jackson as a day of
thanksgiving and prayer, and the next day
(Sunday) the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was celebrated
by the Christian soldiers from all the army.
General Jackson was present at this service,
and partook of the sacred feast in company
with his men.</p>
<p>On the 16th of June, General Jackson
ordered Colonel Munford to press down the
pike, if possible, as far as New Market, and
to make the enemy believe that his whole
army was advancing. This Colonel Munford
did, and the Federals, believing that Jackson
was again on the march, retreated to
Strasburg and began to fortify themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>In the meanwhile, June 17th, Jackson
had begun a march, but not towards Strasburg.
The mighty army of McClellan had
advanced so close to Richmond that at night
the reflection of its camp-fires could be seen
from the city; and General Lee sent for
Jackson to come to his aid as swiftly as
possible.</p>
<p>Great care was taken to make the Federals
believe that troops were being sent to
Jackson, so that he could again go down
the Valley, and attack Fremont and Shields
at Strasburg. A division of men was sent
as far as Staunton, and the report was spread
that a large force was on the march to Jackson;
but the truth was, that our hero was
already on his way to Richmond, where the
next blow was to be struck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>It was important to keep the Federals in
ignorance of Jackson&rsquo;s movement, so Colonel
Munford was ordered to make a great show
with his men along the turnpike, and to
allow no news to be carried to the foe. The
men were told to give this answer to all
questions, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; The historian
Cooke tells us this amusing incident, which
grew out of the above order: &ldquo;One of
Hood&rsquo;s men left the ranks to go to a cherry-tree
near by, when Jackson rode past and
saw him. &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; asked
the General. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied the
soldier. &lsquo;To what command do you belong?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, what State are you
from?&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is the meaning
of all this?&rsquo; asked Jackson. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; was
the reply, &lsquo;Old Stonewall and General Hood
issued orders yesterday that we were not to
know anything until after the next fight.&rsquo;
Jackson laughed and rode on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 25th of June, the corps reached
Ashland, near Richmond.</p>
<p>Jackson had gone on in advance to the
headquarters of General Lee, where his post
in the coming strife was assigned him.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">A Major-General.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line3"><span class="smallest">(CONTINUED.)</span></span></h2>
<p>General McClellan was now on the banks
of the Chickahominy river, at one point only
six miles from Richmond, with the largest
and best equipped army that had ever been
raised upon American soil.</p>
<p>His position was a strong one, having the
P&#257;mun&prime;key river on one side and the James
on the other, with the marshes of the Chickahominy
in front as natural barriers to the
assaults of the Confederates. Besides, he
had thoroughly fortified his line, which swept
in a crescent shape from Meadow Bridge
road on the right, across the Chickahominy,
to the Williamsburg road on the left&mdash;a distance
of about fifteen miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>General Lee now determined to send General
Jackson to the rear of the enemy to
turn their flank, while General A. P. Hill
and Longstreet assailed them in front.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 26th of June, General
A. P. Hill advanced upon Mechanicsville
and attacked the strong
position of the Federals. The
latter defended themselves
bravely, but at last fell back
to their works on Beaverdam
creek. The victorious Confederates
followed, and an
artillery fire was kept up until nine o&rsquo;clock
at night. The attack was renewed at dawn
the next morning and raged for hours, when,
suddenly, the Federals retreated in haste from
their strong position, leaving everything in
flames.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic33">
<img src="images/p33.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="507" />
<p class="caption"><i>Gen. A. P. Hill.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Jackson had come up, turned their flank,
and caused them to retire. Generals Hill
and Longstreet followed them until about
noon, when they found the Federals again
drawn up for battle behind Powhite creek,
on a ridge whose slope was fortified by
breastworks of trees, and whose crest was
crowned with batteries of frowning guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>The Confederate troops at once advanced,
but were repulsed with great loss. Again
they charged up the hill, and gained the
crest only to be driven back by the storm
of shot and shell.</p>
<p>Longstreet was now ordered to make a
move on the right towards Gaines&rsquo;s Mill,
where the Federals were massed in a strong
position. In the meanwhile General Lee
ordered General Jackson to advance to the
help of Hill. About five o&rsquo;clock P. M. the
sound of guns was heard to the left, and
soon Jackson&rsquo;s corps was in the thickest of
the fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Before them were a swamp, a deep stream,
masses of felled timber, and a wood filled
with armed men, and cannon belching forth
shot and shell. The work was hard, but
when Jackson gave the order, his men swept
forward with wild cheers and a roar of
musketry, while above the clang arose the
cry of Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!</p>
<p>The men rushed on through the swamp,
across the creek, and up into the wood, and
drove the enemy from point to point until
they gained the top of the hill.</p>
<p>On the right of the line, Hood&rsquo;s Texas
brigade charged with a yell,
leaped ditch and stream, and
drove the foe pell-mell before
them. In this charge they
lost one thousand men, but
took fourteen cannon and
nearly a regiment of prisoners.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic34">
<img src="images/p34.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="518" />
<p class="caption"><i>General J. B. Hood.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The enemy now retreated in wild disorder
all along the line, and the battle of Old Cold
Harbor was won by the Confederates. The
very name of Jackson had struck terror to
the foe!</p>
<p>The next morning, the 29th of June, Jackson
was ordered to move on the rear of
McClellan&rsquo;s army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>At Savage Station, the Confederates,
under General Magruder, had a fierce fight
with the rear guard of the Federals. At
nightfall the latter again gave way, leaving
behind vast stores and a number of wounded
men. While the battle at Savage Station
had been going on, the main body of the
Federal army passed over the bridge at
White Oak swamp, destroyed it, and were
for awhile safe, for the Confederates could
not pass over the marshy stream under the
fire of the Federals, who were massed on the
opposite bank.</p>
<p>General Jackson opened fire with his
artillery, and the next morning, the 1st of
July, forced the passage of White Oak
swamp, and captured a part of the Federal
artillery.</p>
<p>In the meantime a fierce battle had been
fought at Frasier&rsquo;s farm, by Generals Longstreet
and A. P. Hill, with another portion
of McClellan&rsquo;s army. Under cover of night,
the latter drew off, leaving his dead and
wounded, and a large number of prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>General Jackson was now placed in front
of the Confederate forces in pursuit of the
foe, who was nearing the James river.
It was General Lee&rsquo;s plan to cut them off
from the river and destroy the whole army,
but the Confederates were worn out with
much fighting, and General McClellan was
allowed to make a stand on Malvern Hill.
This strong position he had hastily fortified;
and here, as a wild animal at bay, was his
whole army, determined to contend for
existence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>General Lee ordered an assault, placing
Jackson and D. H. Hill on the left and
Magruder on the right. Owing to the timber
and marshes, the Confederates could use
but little artillery, while the Federals, from
their greater height, rained a storm of shot
and shell from three hundred cannon.
The gunboats on the James also threw
their monstrous shells above the heads of the
Confederates. In spite of all odds, these
devoted men (Jackson&rsquo;s) charged across
marshes and up the hill, forcing the enemy
back; but, after a fierce combat, they fell
back with great loss. Again and again
they charged, with the same result. At sunset,
Magruder, who with much difficulty had
gotten his troops into position, charged on
the right with great bravery.</p>
<p>As darkness came on, the Confederates
fought with renewed courage. Whole lines
of the enemy fell beneath their musket fire,
but the guns could not be taken by the
Confederates, because no line of men could
live within the zone of fire which flamed
from the mouths of the blazing cannon.</p>
<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock P. M. the firing ceased,
and the Confederate troops, holding their
position, slept upon the battle-field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>When the battle had ended thus, Jackson
went slowly to the rear, where his faithful
servant, Jim, was waiting for him with food
and a pallet made upon the ground. After
eating a few morsels, Jackson lay down and
fell into a deep sleep. About one o&rsquo;clock,
Generals Hill, Ewell, and Early came to tell
him that their commands were cut to pieces,
and that when day broke they would not
be able to continue the fight. Jackson listened
to them in silence, and then said:
&ldquo;McClellan and his army will be gone by
daylight.&rdquo; The generals thought him mad,
but when morning came, they found that he
had foretold aright the flight of McClellan.
Malvern Hill was found to be deserted by
the foe. They had retreated during the
night to Harrison&rsquo;s landing, under cover of
their gunboats, and Richmond was for the
time safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>The battle of Malvern Hill was a dearly
bought victory for the Confederates. General
Jackson lost in the battle three hundred
and seventy-seven men killed, and one thousand
seven hundred and forty-six wounded,
with thirty-nine missing. As soon as possible,
the Southern army followed McClellan,
but found him too strongly entrenched to
attack. So the worn-out men went into
camp near by, and rested for the first time
in a fortnight.</p>
<p>General Jackson soon grew weary of
watching McClellan, and began to plan a
bold march into Maryland to threaten Washington
city. It was not long before he did
move northward. News came that a Federal
army of forty thousand men, under General
Pope, was coming towards Gordonsville
to the help of McClellan. General Jackson
was at once ordered to advance to meet him
and drive him back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>His corps moved forward, and, on August
9th, fought the battle of Cedar Run. In
this fierce battle one of the regiments began
to fall back. At that instant Jackson placed
himself in front of his men, drew his sword,
and cried in a voice of thunder, &ldquo;Rally,
brave men! Jackson will lead you! Follow
me!&rdquo; This turned the tide of battle, and the
Federal army broke into full retreat. Just
before this battle, some officers enquired
of &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; the General&rsquo;s servant, if there
were any signs of a battle. &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&rdquo;
replied he, &ldquo;the General is a great man
for praying night and morning, all times;
but when I see him get up in the night and
go off and pray, then I know there is going
to be something to pay; and I go right
straight and pack his haversack, for I know
he will call for it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Lee now came up with the greater
part of the Southern army, leaving only a
small force to watch General McClellan.
The plan of the Southern leaders was to rout
General Pope and march northward to
threaten Washington, thus compelling General
McClellan to leave his camp on the
James river.</p>
<p>The main body of Lee&rsquo;s army moved
nearer to Pope&rsquo;s front, while Jackson&rsquo;s corps
moved off to the northwest, and was again
&ldquo;lost.&rdquo; It was marching across the Rappahannock
and behind Bull Run mountains,
which hid it from the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>

<p class="caption"><i>General Jackson preparing for battle.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>On August 26th it passed through the
mountains at Thoroughfare Gap, and took a
position between Pope and Washington city.</p>
<p>Jackson at once took Manassas Junction,
where three hundred prisoners and immense
quantities of stores were captured. The
poor, hungry soldiers took what could be
carried away, and the rest was burned.</p>
<p>As soon as Pope heard that Jackson was
in his rear, he moved to meet him, and
ordered McDowell to close in upon him from
the direction of Gainesville, saying, &ldquo;We
shall bag the whole crowd.&rdquo; But the wary
Jackson was a match for his foes. Taking
a good position upon the old battle-field of
Manassas, he at once attacked the enemy
coming up on the evening of August 28th.
When darkness fell upon the blood-drenched
plain, the Confederates were the victors.
On the next morning the fight was renewed,
but Jackson&rsquo;s men were almost exhausted,
when Longstreet&rsquo;s corps appeared and soon
turned the tide of battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>It was not long before Pope&rsquo;s army was
in full retreat towards Washington, and
Jackson was again victor. During a part
of the battle a severe storm came up. An
aide from General A. P. Hill rode up, and
reported that his ammunition was wet, and
asked leave to retire. &ldquo;Give my compliments
to General Hill,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;and
tell him that the Yankee ammunition is as
wet as his; to stay where he is.&rdquo; &ldquo;There
was always blood and danger,&rdquo; says a friend,
&ldquo;when Jackson began his sentences with,
&lsquo;Give my compliments.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Lee now determined to cross the
Potomac and threaten Washington, and
Jackson led the advance. On September
6th he reached Frederick and remained there
several days, resting and refitting his command.
When General Lee came up, he at
once sent General Jackson to Harper&rsquo;s Ferry
(September 10th), to capture the Federal
forces at that place. After taking the
heights around that town, he proceeded to
take the town by storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>In a short while the garrison of eleven
thousand men, with seventy-three cannon,
thirteen thousand stand of small-arms and
a vast amount of stores, surrendered. Jackson,
leaving General Hill to receive the
captured prisoners and property, at once set
out to return to General Lee, at Sharpsburg,
a little village two and one-half miles from
the Potomac river. After a weary night-march
he reached that place on the morning
of the 16th. He found General Lee facing
the hosts of McClellan and drawn up for
battle. When he had rested his worn-out
men for several hours, he took his position
on the left, next to the Potomac river. This
was the post of danger, for against it, on the
17th, McClellan massed forty-four thousand
men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The corps of Jackson numbered now, after
so much fighting and marching, less than
seven thousand men, but this little band
held the ground throughout the day, and
bravely drove back every assault of the
enemy.</p>
<p>When night closed the bloody fray, each
army held its own position. On the next
morning, General Lee awaited another attack,
but General McClellan had received so
heavy a blow that he would not venture
another battle until fresh troops had come up.</p>
<p>The 18th was spent by both armies in
burying their dead and caring for the
wounded. In the evening General Lee,
learning that large bodies of fresh troops
were reaching McClellan, determined to
recross the Potomac. As soon as night
came, the troops began to move towards the
ford at Shepherdstown. &ldquo;For hours,&rdquo; says
Dr. Dabney, &ldquo;Jackson was seen seated upon
his horse, motionless as a statue, watching
the passage until the last man and the last
carriage had touched the Southern shore.&rdquo;
The battle of Sharpsburg, or Antietam
(An t&#275;&prime;tam), as it is sometimes called, was
a drawn battle&mdash;neither side was victorious,
each losing in killed and wounded about
twelve thousand men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The Southern men were so worn out and
foot-sore from constant marching, and weak
from starvation, that they were really unfit
for the battle of Sharpsburg. More than
half of Lee&rsquo;s army was left behind along the
Virginia roads, and those who, wan and
gaunt, fought the battle, were kept up
during that bloody day only by their devotion
to the Southern cause and leaders.
Fortune also had smiled upon McClellan
by revealing to him the plans of Lee. An
order setting forth Lee&rsquo;s line of march was
picked up in D. H. Hill&rsquo;s deserted camp,
and taken to McClellan, who then, of course,
knew just where to strike Lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, a force of
Federals crossed the Potomac at Boteler&rsquo;s
ford, but were met by A. P. Hill&rsquo;s division
of Jackson&rsquo;s corps, and driven back into the
river with great loss. On the northern side
of the river, seventy large cannon were
planted, which rained grape-shot upon the
Southern men, but they rushed forward and
hurled hundreds of the Federals into the
water, and then picked them off with steady
aim until the river was black with floating
bodies.</p>
<p>While this was going on, a messenger
from General Lee found Jackson watching
the progress of the fight. His only remark
was, &ldquo;With the blessing of Providence,
they will soon be driven back.&rdquo; McClellan
made no further attempt to follow Lee.</p>
<p>For some weeks Lee&rsquo;s army lay quietly
resting in the lower Valley. But Jackson
was never idle. He was now busy in getting
clothes and shoes for his men, and
filling up the ranks which had been so
thinned during the summer. His regiments
were at the time filled up by the return of
the sick and the foot-sore and by new recruits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Jackson had now become the idol of his
men. Their pet name for him was &ldquo;Old
Jack.&rdquo; Whenever he rode by they would
cheer themselves hoarse; and his devotion
to them was just as great. This story is
told of him by an eye-witness of the scene:
&ldquo;When Jackson&rsquo;s men were on their famous
march to Manassas, at the close of the first
day, they found Jackson, who had ridden
forward, dismounted, and standing upon a
great stone by the road-side. His sun-burned
cap was lifted from his brow and his blue
eyes gleamed in the rays of the setting sun.
His men burst forth into cheers, but he at
once sent an officer to request that there be
no cheering, as it might betray their presence
to the enemy. Instantly the cheering
stopped, but as they passed their General
their eyes told what their lips could not
utter&mdash;their love for him. Jackson turned
to his staff, his face beaming with delight,
and said, &lsquo;Who could not conquer with such
troops as these?&rsquo;&rdquo; Well might he be proud
of men who had been marching and fighting
for five days, many of them having no rations
and living upon green corn found along the
way, yet whose courage and devotion knew
no bounds!</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A Lieutenant-General.</span></h2>
<p>While our hero was in the lower Valley,
on the 11th of October, 1862, the Confederate
Government bestowed upon him the
rank of Lieutenant-General, next to the
highest grade in the service. General Lee&rsquo;s
army was now divided into two great corps,
one of which was given to Jackson, the
other to Longstreet. These generals have
been called the &ldquo;two hands&rdquo; of Lee.</p>
<p>On the 18th of October, General Jackson&rsquo;s
corps was sent forward to destroy the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad. This they did in
the most complete way. Burning all the
bridges and ripping up the cross-ties, they
finished their work by setting fire to the ties
and throwing the iron rails upon the heaps
of blazing logs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>After the work was done, Jackson rode
over the whole distance, thirty miles, to see
that the destruction was complete.</p>
<p>Towards the end of October, Jackson
moved his corps
near the Blue
Ridge mountains
to watch the
movements of
McClellan, who
was again crossing
the Potomac
with a vast army
of one hundred
and forty thousand
men.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic36">
<img src="images/p36.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="600" />
<p class="caption"><i>General James Longstreet.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But McClellan&rsquo;s movements were so slow
that he was removed from his command,
and General Burnside was put in his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The latter general resolved to try a new
way to Richmond, and moved his army
towards Fredericksburg, on the Rappahannock
river. General Lee at once marched
to that town to meet him. General Jackson
was called from the Valley to the help of
Lee, and reached that general&rsquo;s camp on the
1st of December. The Southern army numbered
in all about sixty-five thousand men.
Of these, there were in Jackson&rsquo;s corps
twenty-five thousand.</p>
<p>General Lee, with his two corps, was now
upon the heights south of the Rappahannock
river; while General Burnside, with five
corps, held Stafford Heights, north of that
river. The town of Fredericksburg was
between the two armies. The winter set in
early, and both armies suffered greatly from
the cold. The Confederates were for the
most part barefooted, without tents and
warm clothes, and had only rations of fat
meat and corn bread; but these trials did
not lessen their valor. They dug out trenches
and threw up breastworks, and waited for
the advance of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>On the 10th of December, General Burnside
began to move his men over the river
on pontoon bridges. One hundred and fifty
big guns on Stafford Heights poured shot
and shell upon the town of Fredericksburg,
setting it on fire and causing many of the
people to leave their homes. By the morning
of the 13th, ninety thousand Federals
had crossed the river. Longstreet held the
Confederate left while Jackson held the right.</p>
<p>The battle began by a fierce attack upon
Jackson&rsquo;s right, which onset was bravely
met; for the men, fighting fiercely, drove the
Federals back to the cover of their big guns.
At eleven A. M., the Federals assaulted
Longstreet&rsquo;s position, but again and again
they were driven back by the Confederates,
who did not fire until the foe was close upon
them. Charge after charge was made by
the Federals, but to no purpose, for the grim
Confederates held their own.</p>
<p>When night came, thirteen thousand Federals
lay dead or wounded upon the frozen
plain, while the Confederates had lost five
thousand brave men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>There is no doubt that Jackson ordered a
night attack upon Burnside&rsquo;s beaten army,
hoping thereby to turn a defeat into a rout,
and to drive them pell-mell into the river, as
he had done at Boteler&rsquo;s ford; but his
better judgment told him that it was unwise
to send his men against the strong works
along the river road, under the fierce fire of
the cannon on Stafford Heights.</p>
<p>So he recalled the order, and thus lost the
chance of a decisive victory; for Burnside
did not offer battle again, but on the night
of the 16th, in the midst of a great storm
of wind and rain, withdrew his forces to
their post on Stafford Heights.</p>
<p>Both armies now went into winter quarters.
Jackson&rsquo;s corps built huts in the
forests, and made themselves as comfortable
as possible, while their General accepted for
his lodgings a cottage at Moss Neck, the
home of Mr. Corbin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Here he set to work to write out reports
to the government of his wonderful battles.
This he did with great clearness and regard
for the truth, recording briefly the exploits
of his little army.</p>
<p>Never had general a more glorious story
to relate!</p>
<p>Since the battle of Kernstown, in March,
these brave men had fought the big battles
of McDowell, Cross Keys, Port Republic,
Cold Harbor, Malvern Hill, Cedar Run,
Manassas, Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, Antietam, and
Fredericksburg&mdash;marched hundreds of miles,
and captured thousands of prisoners. Never
had they quailed in battle; when ammunition
had given out they fought with
stones, and when there had been no rations,
they lived on roots and berries. So
rapidly did they march from place to
place that they were called the &ldquo;foot cavalry,&rdquo;
and the knowledge that Jackson was
&ldquo;lost,&rdquo; cast terror into the ranks of the toe.
Even their best generals could not tell where
Jackson would next be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;During the battle of Cold Harbor,&rdquo;
relates one of Jackson&rsquo;s men, &ldquo;as we were
taking back some prisoners, one of them
said: &lsquo;You think that you are doing great
things here, but I tell you we are whipping
&ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo; in the Valley like smoke.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, maybe you are,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;being as
&ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo; is <i>here</i>. You&rsquo;ve been fighting
his men all day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, Jackson rode by with his staff.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s our General,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;now, how
much are you whipping us in the Valley?&rdquo;
The man looked dazed, and said, &ldquo;Well, my
stars, if that <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> &lsquo;Old Jack!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the feats of Jackson had now made
him famous. Not only his own people, but
strangers from Europe made visits to the
camp to see the great general and his men.</p>
<p>During these months of rest, Jackson
enjoyed greatly the visits of General Stuart,
who made the mess merry with his jokes
and gay laughter. He also made the acquaintance
of little six-year-old Jane Corbin,
who lived near by in the big house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>Every evening when the work of the day
was over, she would run across to see the
General, who would always have some little
present for her. One evening, having no
other gift for her, he ripped off the one band
of gold braid from around his new cap, and
placed it upon her sunny brow.</p>
<p>This lovely child lived only a few months
thereafter. The very day on which General
Jackson left Moss Neck in the spring, little
Jane was seized with scarlet-fever and died
after being ill only one day. General Jackson
mourned greatly for his little friend.
About the same time he heard of the illness
of his own baby daughter, whom he had
never seen.</p>
<p>He had never had a furlough since leaving
Lexington, and in April, since he could not
visit his dear ones, they came to him. He
found a quiet home for his wife near by, and
great was his pleasure in nursing and
caressing his little daughter. He gave her
his mother&rsquo;s name&mdash;Julia.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>General Jackson crowning Jane Corbin.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>During the winter, at Moss Neck, the piety
of General Jackson seemed ever to increase.
His chief thought was to live for the glory
of God. He often worshiped with his men
in the log church which they had built in
the forest, and toiled early and late for their
welfare.</p>
<p>Cooke, the historian, tells us that one day,
while talking with a member of his staff
about the great battle which he knew would
soon take place, he said: &ldquo;My trust is in
God.&rdquo; A brief silence followed these words,
and then, rising to his feet, he exclaimed,
with flashing eyes, &ldquo;I wish they would
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spirit of battle was upon him, and he
longed to go forward to the fray, which
proved to be the last, but not least, of his
wonderful exploits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>General Burnside had been removed from
command of the Federal army after the battle
of Fredericksburg, and General Hooker,
&ldquo;Fighting Joe,&rdquo; as he was called, was put
in his place. His army now numbered about
one hundred and fifty thousand men.</p>
<p>General Lee&rsquo;s army, to the number of forty-five
thousand men, lay entrenched upon the
southern banks of the Rappahannock river.
General Longstreet&rsquo;s corps was now absent
in Suffolk county, so Lee had not one-third
as many men as Hooker.</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s plan was to divide his army into
two parts. The smaller part was to cross
the river near Fredericksburg and engage
the Confederates in battle, while the larger
part would march up the northern bank of
the Rappahannock river, and, crossing over,
reach the flank of Lee&rsquo;s army, which would
thus have the foe in front and also in the
rear. At the same time Hooker planned to
send a large troop of cavalry to reach and
destroy the railroads leading to Richmond,
thus cutting General Lee off from the capital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>This was a bold plan, but one that was
easily guessed by such soldiers as Lee,
Jackson, and Stuart. The last named kept
watch, and as soon as a movement was
made, reported it to Lee. Lee at once fell
back to Chancellorsville, but not until the
main army under General Hooker himself
had reached &ldquo;The Wilderness&rdquo; beyond
Chancellorsville, and thrown up strong
earthworks. The left wing of Hooker&rsquo;s
army, under General Sedgwick, crossed the
river below Fredericksburg on the 29th of
April, and was at once met by Jackson,
who was ever watchful. Sedgwick, however,
did not intend to fight, but merely to keep
General Lee at Fredericksburg while Hooker
was gaining the point on Lee&rsquo;s flank. General
Lee promptly guessed the plan, and
ordered General Jackson to leave only one
division in front of Sedgwick, to proceed at
once in search of Hooker, and to attack and
repulse him. This order reached Jackson
about eight P. M., and by midnight his
troops were on the march. Early the next
day they reached the battle-field, where the
troops of General Anderson were already
engaged with the enemy.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic38">
<img src="images/p38.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="525" />
<p class="caption"><i>Lee, Jackson, and Stuart at the battle of Fredericksburg.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Jackson halted his column, and sending
four brigades to the support of Anderson,
drew up the remainder of the corps in line
of battle upon a ridge near by. The battle
raged fiercely all day, and when night came,
the Confederates had reached Hooker&rsquo;s first
line of entrenchments, in the midst of the
dense forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Meanwhile General Lee had come up with
the remainder of the army, and a sharp fight
had taken place in front of Hooker&rsquo;s right
wing. Night put an end to the contest,
when, weary and worn, both armies lay down
to rest upon the battle-field.</p>
<p>When Lee and Jackson met that night
they were joined by General Stuart, who
told them that, though General Hooker had
strongly fortified his position upon the east,
south, and southwest, upon the north and
west he had left it open. Jackson&rsquo;s quick
mind at once planned to attack Hooker in
the rear, just as Hooker had planned to
attack Lee.</p>
<p>To the northwest, there were no earthworks,
and if Jackson could surprise the
Federals he would be almost sure of victory.
Stuart was there with his gallant horsemen
to cover this movement, and the forests were
so dense that Jackson was sure of leading
his men silently to the rear of Hooker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>General Lee listened to his arguments,
and finally gave consent for his great lieutenant
to make the trial. He (General Lee)
would remain with two divisions in front to
engage Hooker, while Jackson would march
around and strike him in the rear.</p>
<p>By the aid of his chaplain, Rev. Mr. Lacy,
who knew that country well, General Jackson
found a road which would lead him to
the rear of Hooker&rsquo;s army. By sunrise he
was in the saddle at the head of his column.
General Stuart was there to cover his line
of march, and his troops, knowing at once
that their General was making one of his
famous flank movements, went forward at a
rapid pace. We are told by Dr. McGuire,
who was with Jackson, that on the march
they were met by General Fitz. Lee, who
told Jackson that he would show him the
whole of Hooker&rsquo;s army if he would go to
the top of a hill near by. They went
together, and Jackson carefully viewed
through his glasses the Federal command.
He was so wrapped up in his plans that on
his return he forgot to salute or thank Fitz.
Lee, but hurried on to the column, where he
ordered one of his aides to go forward and
tell General Rodes to cross the plank road
and go straight on to the turnpike, and
another aide to go to the rear of the column
and see that it was kept closed up, and all
along the line he kept saying, &ldquo;Press on,
press right on.&rdquo; The fiercest energy seemed
to possess him. When he arrived at the
plank road he sent this, his last, message
to Lee: &ldquo;The enemy has made a stand at
Chancellorsville. I hope as soon as practicable
to attack. I trust that an ever kind
Providence will bless us with success.&rdquo; At
three P. M., having marched fifteen miles,
he had reached the old turnpike, and was
exactly on the opposite side of the enemy to
that held by General Lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>He had left the Stonewall Brigade, under
General Paxton, on the plank road, with
orders to block the way to Germanna ford.
He found the outposts held by Stuart&rsquo;s vigilant
troopers, who had guarded well his
advance. As soon as possible he formed
his army in three lines&mdash;the division of
Rodes in front, that of Colston next, and
A. P. Hill&rsquo;s in the rear. Between five and
six P. M. the word was given, and the lines
marched forward into the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The thickets were so dense that many of
the soldiers had the clothes torn from their
backs, but on they went, sometimes creeping
to get through the thick undergrowth.
After a march of two miles they came suddenly
upon the right wing of Hooker&rsquo;s army.
The men were scattered about, cooking and
eating their suppers, wholly unconscious of
the approach of the dreaded Jackson. With
a wild yell, the Confederates dashed forward
and drove the enemy pell-mell through the
forests for three miles. Jackson&rsquo;s only order
was &ldquo;Press forward,&rdquo; and onward rushed his
devoted men after the terrified fugitives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock the line of Rodes was
within a mile of Chancellorsville, still in the
forest, when General Jackson ordered the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill to advance to the
front to relieve those of Rodes, who were
worn out with marching and fighting.</p>
<p>He knew that Hooker would send forward
other troops, so he went to the front himself
to get his men in order. As he rode along
the line he would say, &ldquo;Men, get into line!
Get into line!&rdquo; Turning to Colonel Cobb, he
sent him to tell General Rodes to take possession
of a barricade in front, and then rode
away towards the turnpike.</p>
<p>But before the broken ranks of Rodes
could gain the barricade Hooker sent forward
a large body of fresh troops, and the battle
was renewed all along the line.</p>
<p>It was now ten o&rsquo;clock, and the pale moon
sent her silvery rays down into the heart of
the dismal Wilderness, whose echoes awoke
to the sound of tramping feet, the rattle of
musketry, and the groans of the dying.
Through moonlight and shadow, with these
sounds ringing in his ears, Jackson rode forward
to his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>After riding up the turnpike a short distance,
he found the enemy advancing. Turning,
he rode back rapidly towards his own
line. The Southern men lying hid in the
thickets, thinking that Jackson and his staff
were a squad of Northern cavalry, opened a
rapid fire upon them. So deadly was their
aim that nearly every horse in the party was
killed. Two officers were killed, others hurt,
and General Jackson himself was wounded
three times. His left arm was broken just
below the shoulder joint, and was also
wounded lower down. A third ball had
entered the palm of his right hand and
broken two bones.</p>
<p>His left hand, so cruelly hurt, dropped by
his side, and his horse, no longer controlled
by the reins, ran back towards the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>As the horse galloped between two trees,
he passed beneath a low bough, which
struck his rider in the face, tore off his cap,
and threw him violently back in the saddle.
He did not fall, however, but grasped the
reins with his bleeding right hand, and
turned him back into the road. There,
the General found the greatest confusion.
Horses, mad with pain and fright, were
running in every direction, and in the road
lay the wounded and dying.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic39">
<img src="images/p39.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="510" />
<p class="caption"><i>Where General Jackson fell.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Captain Wilbourne, one of Jackson&rsquo;s
aides, now seized the reins and stopped his
horse. Seeing that the General was badly
hurt, he lifted him from the saddle, almost
fainting from the loss of blood. He was
then laid down by the side of the road, his
head resting upon Captain Wilbourne&rsquo;s
breast, while a messenger went to summon
Dr. McGuire, his chief surgeon. Soon General
Hill came up, and, pulling off the General&rsquo;s
gauntlets, found that his left arm
was broken.</p>
<p>As the enemy were not far off, his arm
was quickly bandaged with a handkerchief,
and he attempted to walk. But after they
had gone a few steps a litter was brought,
and the General was placed upon it.</p>
<p>The litter was hardly in motion when the
fire from the guns of the enemy became terrible.
Many men were struck down by it,
among whom were General Hill and one of
the bearers of the litter.</p>
<p>The litter was placed upon the ground,
and the officers lay down by it to escape
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>After awhile the fire changed, and Jackson
rose to his feet and walked slowly on, leaning
upon two members of his staff. General
Pender, coming up, saw by the moonlight
that General Jackson was badly hurt. &ldquo;Ah!
General,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am sorry to see that
you have been wounded. The
lines here are so much broken
that I fear we will have to
fall back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic40">
<img src="images/p40.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="496" />
<p class="caption"><i>General Pender.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Though almost fainting,
Jackson raised his head, and
said: &ldquo;You must hold your
ground, General Pender! You must hold
your ground!&rdquo; This was the last order of
Jackson on the field.</p>
<p>The General, being very faint, was again
placed on the litter, and the whole party
moved through the forest towards the hospital
at Wilderness Run.</p>
<p>As they were going slowly through the
undergrowth, one of the men caught his
foot in a grapevine and fell, letting the litter
fall to the ground.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Jackson fell upon his wounded shoulder,
and for the first time groaned most piteously.
With great difficulty they made their way
until they came to a place in the road where
an ambulance was waiting. The General
was placed in it, and was soon met by his
surgeon, Dr. McGuire, who, having sprung
into the ambulance, found the General
almost pulseless.</p>
<p>Some spirits was given him, which revived
him, and ere long he was laid tenderly
in a camp bed at the hospital. Here he fell
into a deep sleep. About midnight he was
awakened, and told by Dr. McGuire that it
was thought best to amputate his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what you think best, Doctor,&rdquo; was
the calm reply.</p>
<p>The arm was amputated, and the ball
taken out of his right hand by the skillful
surgeon, and he again fell into a quiet sleep,
which lasted until nine o&rsquo;clock on Sunday
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>General Hill being wounded, General
Stuart was placed in command of Jackson&rsquo;s
corps. He now determined to wait until
morning to attack the strong works of
Hooker, which were again in front of the
Confederates.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic42">
<img src="images/p42.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="476" />
<p class="caption"><i>Gen. J. E. B. Stuart.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The next morning Stuart
thundered on the west, and
Lee on the east and south.
When the Stonewall Brigade
went forward, they shouted,
&ldquo;Charge, and remember Jackson!&rdquo; &ldquo;But
even as they moved from their position,&rdquo;
says Dr. Dabney, &ldquo;their General, Paxton,
the friend and former adjutant of Jackson,
was killed where he stood. But his men
rushed forward, and, without other leader
than the <i>name</i> which formed their battle-cry,
swept everything before them.&rdquo; At ten
A. M., May 3d, Chancellorsville was taken
by Lee, and the Federals took refuge behind
new barricades nearer to the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>In the meantime, General Sedgwick, who
had been left at Fredericksburg by General
Hooker, attacked General Early, and captured
a part of his command. General Lee,
having Hooker in check, sent help to Early,
and on Wednesday, came up himself and
drove General Sedgwick back across the
river, where Hooker had already retreated
on Tuesday night, May 5th.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic43">
<img src="images/p42a.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="601" />
<p class="caption"><i>General Jubal A. Early.</i></p>
</div>
<p>When General Jackson
awoke on Sunday morning,
May 3d, he asked one
of his aids to go to Richmond
for his wife. He had
sent her to that city when
the Federals had begun to
move across the river. His
mind was clear and he
stated that if he had had one more hour of
daylight, he would have cut off the enemy
from the United States ford, and they would
have been obliged either to fight their way
out or to surrender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>It was now thought best to take him to a
more quiet place; so on Monday he was
moved to Mr. Chandler&rsquo;s near Guinea&rsquo;s
Depot, where every care was taken to make
him comfortable. He seemed to take much
interest in hearing of the battle on Sunday,
and said of the Stonewall Brigade, &ldquo;They
are a noble body of men. The men who
live through this war will be proud to say,
&lsquo;I was one of the Stonewall Brigade.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then went on to say that the name of
Stonewall belonged to the men of the Brigade
alone, as they had earned it by their steadfast
conduct at First Manassas. He spoke
also of General Rodes, and
said that on account of
gallant conduct, he deserved
to be advanced to
the rank of major-general.</p>
<p>The death of General
Paxton gave him great
distress, but he grew
calmer when told of the glorious exploits of
his old brigade.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic44">
<img src="images/p43.jpg" alt="" width="431" height="600" />
<p class="caption"><i>General R. E. Rodes.</i></p>
</div>
<p>He was much pleased at this noble letter
from General Lee:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>General</i>:</p>
<p>I have just received your note, informing me
that you were wounded. I cannot express my
regret at the occurrence. Could I have directed
events, I should have chosen, for the good of the
country, to have been disabled in your stead.</p>
<p>I congratulate you upon the victory which is
due to your skill and energy.</p>
<p><span class="center">Most truly yours,</span>
<span class="jr">(Signed) R. E. LEE, <i>General</i>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mind seemed ever dwelling on religious
subjects, and he was entirely submissive
to the will of God.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, his wounds were doing so
well that it was thought possible to take
him by railroad to Richmond. On that
night, however, while Dr. McGuire was
absent from him for awhile, he was taken
with a severe pain in his side, which was
in fact due to pneumonia, which had now
set in.</p>
<p>From that time he grew weaker, and at
last it was seen that he could live only a
few hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Mrs. Jackson arrived on Thursday, and to
her he said, &ldquo;I know you would gladly give
your life for me, but I am perfectly resigned.&rdquo;
When his weeping wife at last told him that
death was near, he whispered, &ldquo;Very good,
very good, it is all right.&rdquo; He then sent
messages to many friends, and desired to be
buried in Lexington, in the Valley of Virginia.</p>

<img src="images/p44.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="510" />
<p class="caption"><i>Julia Jackson at the age of four years.</i></p>
</div>
<p>His little girl was now brought in to
receive his last farewell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Upon seeing her, his face lit up with a bright
smile, and he murmured, &ldquo;Little darling!&rdquo;
He tried to caress her with his poor maimed
hand&mdash;she smiling in her delight at seeing
him again. Thus, she remained by his side
upon the bed until it was seen that he was
growing very weak.</p>
<p>Then his mind began to wander, and as
if again upon the battle-field, he cried out:
&ldquo;Order A. P. Hill to prepare for action!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pass the infantry to the front!&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell
Major Hawks to send forward provisions for
the men!&rdquo; Then his vision changed, and
he murmured, &ldquo;Let us cross over the river,
and rest under the shade of the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment had indeed come,&rdquo; says
Cooke, &ldquo;when the great leader was to pass
over the dark river which separates two
worlds, and rest under the shade of the
Tree of Life. From this time, he continued
to sink, and at fifteen minutes past three in
the afternoon, on Sunday, the 10th of May,
he peacefully expired.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Upon the Roll of Fame.</span></h2>
<p>Upon hearing the news of Jackson&rsquo;s
death, the grief of the South was equalled
only by the wish to do him honor.</p>
<p>President Davis sent a
special train to bear his
remains to Richmond. He
also sent, as the gift of the
country, the beautiful new
flag of the Confederate
Congress to be his winding
sheet.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic46">

<p class="caption">Jefferson Davis</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>When the train reached Richmond, it was
met by a vast concourse of weeping people. On
Wednesday, the coffin, preceded by military,
was borne from the Governor&rsquo;s Mansion to
the Capitol through the main streets of the
city. The hearse was drawn by four white
horses and followed by eight generals as pallbearers.
Then came his horse, caparisoned
for battle, and led by his body-servant; then
followed his staff, the President, the Governor
of Virginia, the city authorities, and a vast
number of sorrowing people.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Little Sorrel.&rdquo; General T. J. Jackson&rsquo;s War-Horse, 30 Years Old.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>As the procession moved along, cannon
were fired and bells tolled. At last the
Capitol was reached and the body was
borne, amid the tears of the multitude, into
the building where it lay in state all day.
Twenty thousand persons are said to have
passed in front of the body to gaze for the
last time upon their mighty chief.</p>
<p>It is said that President Davis stood long,
gazing at the quiet face, and then in silence
left the house.</p>
<p>Old soldiers pressed around the bier with
tears streaming down their bronzed faces,
while one stooped and kissed the cold lips
of his beloved commander.</p>
<p>The next day the remains were borne,
attended by a guard of honor, to Lexington,
where they were received by General Smith,
the corps of cadets, the professors, and many
sorrowing citizens. They were borne to the
barracks of the Military Institute and placed
in the old class-room of the dead general.
Every half hour, the cadet battery pealed
forth a fitting requiem to the great teacher of
artillery tactics. Then &ldquo;escorted by infantry,
cavalry, and artillery, under command of
Col. Shipp, and borne to the grave upon a
caisson of the cadet battery,&rdquo; he was laid to
rest beside the graves of his first wife and
child in the beautiful cemetery of Lexington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>The &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; of Lee was thus taken
away just as the heaviest stroke had fallen
upon the enemy. General Lee, the army,
the whole South mourned for their fallen
hero. There were other generals as brave
and true as Jackson, but none who possessed
his keen insight into the movements of the
enemy, his celerity of action, and the wonderful
certainty of victory which made him
the idol of his own soldiers and the dread of
the foe.</p>
<p>But the renown of Jackson is not confined
to the limits of his own land. It has crossed
the ocean, and now the plans of his battles
in the Valley of the Shenandoah and of
Second Manassas and of Chancellorsville are
studied by military men, and used by them
as models of strategy and tactics. All
English-speaking people are justly proud
that the greatest military genius of the age
belongs to them.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Jackson&rsquo;s Statue in Capitol Square, Richmond, Va.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Not long after the end of the war, his
admirers and friends in England presented
to the State of Virginia a statue of Jackson
in bronze. It was placed in the Capitol
Square in Richmond not far from the statue
of Washington and the great Virginians of
his time.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1891, a beautiful and
imposing statue of our hero was erected in
Lexington, Virginia, by his old soldiers and
friends throughout the South. On July
21st of that year, it was unveiled in the
presence of a vast multitude of people.</p>
<p>The anniversary of the First Manassas,
when Jackson, in a &ldquo;baptism of fire,&rdquo; received
the new name of &ldquo;Stonewall,&rdquo; and
flashed like a meteor upon the wondering
world, was thought a fitting day on which
to display to his countrymen his figure in
enduring bronze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>For days and nights, the trains bore into
the historic town crowds of soldiers and
visitors from all parts of the country.
Beautiful arches and mottoes graced the
buildings and highways, and the whole was
crowned by perfect weather.</p>
<p>At 12 o&rsquo;clock, the great parade moved
from the Virginia Military Institute. General
James A. Walker, the only commander
of the Stonewall Brigade then living, was
chief marshal of the day.</p>
<p>As the procession moved on, band after
band of Confederates were seen&mdash;battle-scarred
veterans in the old Confederate
grey, military companies in bright uniforms,
famous generals with bronzed faces and
grizzled hair, the chaplains of the Confederacy,
and visiting camps of veterans from
other States.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Following these came the officers of the
Virginia Military Institute and Washington
and Lee University. Finally came a large
concourse of citizens and carriages. Among
those in the carriages were General Jubal
A. Early, the orator of the day, and his host,
General Custis Lee; the sculptor of the
statue, Edward V. Valentine; Mrs. General
T. J. Jackson and her son-in-law, Mr. Christian,
and his children, Julia and Thomas
Jackson Christian.</p>
<p>At last, the grand-stand in the University
grounds was reached. After prayer and the
reading of three Confederate war poems,
&ldquo;Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s Way,&rdquo; &ldquo;Slain in
Battle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Over the River,&rdquo; General
Early, clad in Confederate grey, made the
address, which gave a simple account of the
great battles fought by Jackson. He was
greeted with hearty cheers, and tears rolled
down the checks of many veterans as they
again in memory fought and marched with
the immortal Jackson.</p>
<p>At the end of the speech the procession
again formed and marched to the cemetery
where stood the monument.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>At the given signal, Mrs. Jackson and her
two grandchildren, Julia Jackson Christian,
aged five years, and Thomas Jackson Christian,
aged three years, mounted the steps
of the platform. A single gun sounded, and
the two children with united hands pulled
the cord and let the veil fall, revealing to
admiring thousands the face and form of
Jackson.</p>
<p>Cheers and shouts rent the air, while the
Rockbridge Artillery fired a salute of fifteen
guns from the cannon which they had used
at Manassas.</p>
<p>The statue, clad in the uniform of a
major-general, stands with the left hand
grasping a sheathed sword, upon which the
weight of the body seems to rest. The right
hand rests upon the thigh and holds a pair
of field glasses, which it would seem that
the General has just been using.</p>
<p>The figure is eight feet high and stands
upon a granite pedestal ten feet tall. Upon
the stone are carved only the words, &ldquo;Jackson,
1824-1863,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stonewall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the monument, in a vault, rest
the remains of the dead soldier and his
daughters, Mrs. Christian, and Mary Graham
who died in infancy.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>The veterans lingered long about their
beloved hero. Many times had they followed
him on the weary march and through the
smoke of battle, and now it seemed as if he
were with them again to lead them on to
victory.</p>
<p>At last, saluting, they marched in silence
away, carrying his image in their memories
and the love of him in their hearts.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will interest my readers to
have a pen and ink portrait of Mrs. Jackson
at that time, as given by a leading journalist
of the day. &ldquo;Mrs. Jackson sat just
behind the famous generals. She wore a
handsome costume of black silk trimmed
with crepe, black gloves, and a crepe bonnet.
Her face is a most attractive one. Her
black hair, still unmixed with grey, was
brushed in graceful waves across her forehead.
Her eyes, large and dark, sparkled
and filled with tears, as veteran after veteran
pressed forward to grasp her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Not long before, her daughter, Mrs. Christian,
the baby Julia whom Jackson had
loved so well, had died, leaving two children,
Julia and Thomas. These children are the
only descendants of our beloved General.
At this writing, in the year of our Lord
1898, Mrs. Jackson is still living, and to
her the hearts of Southern people turn in
fond affection, because she was the best
beloved of their mighty chief.</p>
<p>But not enough had been done to honor
our hero. In 1896, a noble building called
the &ldquo;Jackson Memorial Hall&rdquo; was completed
at the Virginia Military Institute,
and dedicated with fitting ceremony to the
memory of Jackson. In these halls and
beneath the shadow of this building, the
cadets of the South for many long years will
be trained for war. How fit the place!
Near by rest Lee and Stonewall Jackson&mdash;mighty
soldiers, and Christian warriors!</p>
